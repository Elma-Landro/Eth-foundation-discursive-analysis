Titre: Mihai’s Ethereum Project Update. The First Year.\nAuteur: Mihai Alisie\nDate: March 14, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/14/ethereum-the-first-year\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nnto the ethernnello, fellow thereans.  amnnihai lisienn, one of thennthereum foundersnn, and for the past year ’ve served as the ice resident of the thereum oundation and irector of thereum witzerland.nnn the early days of the project  concentrated my attention on the community side and worked on thennholons ideannfor a distributed physical infrastructure however, the project needed someone in witzerland, and  was more useful here focusing on other things.nnuring the the last couple of weeks  started to think about how far we’ve come and how many things we have accomplished since this project started. rom idea to implementation and everything in between, it was (and continues to be) the most intense ride of my life.nnhile contemplating the things that have happened during the past year,  felt inspired to write this post. s  started to go through the posts, tweets and messages published over the last months, the article started to take the shape of a timeline that offers a window into the heart of this project.nn hope you will enjoy it.nnooking back. hat started as a vision.nnogic will get you from  to . magination will take you everywhere.nnlbert insteinnn vividly recall the autumn of  when  first encountered italik’s ethereum idea concentrated in the initial lines of what was going to becomennthe thereum hitepapernn. e sent it to me in an email, mentioning that the message had been sent only to a select few.nnthereum felt different from anything else he’d sent me before. he same rush  felt when  first understood the implications of itcoin was returning, this time with thousands of new multi-dimensional rabbit holes to eplore.nnyself andnnitaliknngo way back to , when we first got in touch and startednnitcoin agazinenntogether.  few months after echanging our first messages over the nternet, wennpublished the first issuennand had a team of passionate people making it happen with nothing more than kype, oogle ocs and little to no money. t definitely wasn’t easy, but it was fun.nnhe mag pushed us into growing at an accelerated rate, each in his own way, opening in the process many opportunities for the both of us. long the way  have gained a deep respect for italik as ’ve watched him grow as a colleague, mind and person. his is why  felt both honored and incredibly ecited when he invited me to be one of the founders of this project in late .nnnd then the rollercoaster left the station.nnetween ecember  and anuary  the focus was mainly on how to bootstrap the vision set forth by italik in the thereum hitepaper. e all ended up agreeing that having a enesis ale was an eciting idea however, it was also one of the most challenging at a strategic level.nnfter long discussions on multiple levels, we decided to postpone the enesis ale from happening in ebruary in order to create annpropernninfrastructure and legal strategy since we were navigating in deep, uncharted territories.nnith that in mind, we scouted a number of jurisdictions, hoping to find one that would work as a base for the project. t was certainly a discouraging effort at times, considering the lack of legal clarity associated with the space we operate in, but we kept pushing.nnhis is how and why, at the end of anuary ,  was landing in urich with the mission of scouting witzerland as a potential jurisdiction for what became in the meantime the thereum roject.nnwitzerland looked interesting from the beginning thanks to its strategic positioning in the heart of urope, being at the same time a financial neus with a friendly business environment, the world’s center for uman ights and a lobal freedom of speech and innovative technology hub. e were not the only ones to see these things as great, in  ay ilent irclennjoining us in the beautiful witzerland for similar reasonsnn.nnhe stage has been set.nne couch-surfed for a while, moving si times in five weeks through various irbnbs while keeping focused on the mission, and in a short time the trip to witzerland turned to be an oasis of hope for thereum. hanks to the friendly and warm wiss crypto community we were not completely alone and we received invaluable local input with regards to what to do and where.nnn less than a month since we first touched down at the urich airport we had annwiss entity up and runningnnand a legal strategy starting to take shape.  big “big up” goes especially to the guys fromnnpen ransactionsnnandnnitcoin uissennfor their help and for the strategic wiss networks they shared with us.nnebruary  was a wild month, with progress being made on all fronts community growth, codebase, wiki content, business infrastructure and legal strategy. uring this month italiknnrevealed thereum for the first timennat the iami conference, we hadnnour first reddit nn, and the core development team solidified into a world-class crypto crew. fter the iami conference,nnavin oodnnandnneffrey ilckenncame on board full-time, although they were working on thereum out of pure passion months before this while building the officialnn++nnandnnnnclients.nnince our launch strategy had changed, instead of launching the enesis ale immediately we chose to release the open source alpha testnet client first. t turned out to be an ecellent decision as it brought us increasing attention from the crypto community as a whole, since people were able to see and test thatnnthe thing actually worksnn.nnarch began in force with the roof of oncept  client being released on the first. n arch th, after a long search, we finally moved into our thereum paceship located in thennbeautiful anton of ugnn.nnhe "spaceship” marks the birth of holon , our wiss thereum .nnetween arch and ay, an area that received considerable attention was the regulatory side of the project. ven if it was frustrating at times, during these months we worked hard on crafting the legal strategy and the optimal organizational structure for the thereum roject while surfing the murky worldwide regulatory waters.nnfter months of strategic legal grinding, on ay th the igital inance ompliance ssociationnnwas creatednnwith the purpose of interfacing with the wiss authorities and providing guidance while also providing assistance and advice for current and new members.nn will most likely become more prominent in the coming months as it will enlarge its focus and interact with other worldwide jurisdictions. n the meantime, for those doing crypto projects in witzerland or looking to relocate into a friendlier jurisdiction, you cannnget in touch with nnfor help and/or more info.nnune brought a nice surprise in the form of thennhiel ellowship being awarded to italiknnfor the cutting-edge work he has been doing with thereum and elsewhere. t the same time it felt like an official recognition of the efforts put into creating this new decentralized ecosystem.nnn the other thereum roject fronts, by une we advanced to the fourth version of the roof of oncept implementations, rapidly moving towards the fifth versionnnour witternnfollowers number surpassed , and the number of globalnnmeetups that focused on thereumnnreached  groups in  different cities, spread over  countries.nnhings started to get big.nnnternally, during this period we had intense soul-searching sessions while also engaging in conversations with the community regarding the nature of the project. ll the discussions converged into one major decisionnnshould we gonnfor-profit or non-profitnnhe decision wasnnto pursue the non-profit routennin order to make sure that the vision does not get corrupted. e all saw what “not being evil” means for some people when profit is involved. he community applauded the decision.nnn uly the idea of a  sec block-timennwas taking shape,nnwe finally had our worldwidennlegal strategynnset up, and the final enesis ale preparations were in full swing – with a strong focus on the design, creation and testing of the sale app and multi-sig system. n a true “nnvictory comes to those who are preparednn” fashion,nnaylornnandnnariannnmanaged to deliver a system able to support a flu of over ’  flawlessly.nnuly th markednnthe birth of the wiss thereum oundationnn, followed on the nd by the release of thennroof of oncept nnand culminating in a bang on the th with thennstart of the enesis alennsynchronized with a secondnnreddit nn.nn have to admit that we all had high hopes, but no one was anticipating that in  hours we would surpass any previous initiative in the space. n any case, it was one of the most fulfilling birthday presents ever and proof that we weren’t crazy – or that there are many other crazy people out there and we’d found each other ^_^nnn the first part of ugust the sale price of ether started to increase from  / to  / towards the last rate of  / while steady progress was being made on the technical front.nnitalik comparednnthe state of thereum at that date with the state of itcoin in mid-. ome catch-up was in order.nns the enesis ale was approaching its end, the focus of the project shifted towards building the thereum core and scaling up the operations. his is also why wenntook the decisionnnto start ramping up development and global operations before the enesis ale ended.nnt turned out to be quite a challenge to establish the banking and financial infrastructure required for a project of this scale however, after many searches and discussions with different entities, we found the solutions we needed.nnn the end, according to wiss law, through the enesis ale we bootstrapped a peer-to-peer platform on which decentralized applications can be developed, deployed and utilized. ther, the world's first and only cryptofuel, serves as a critical component that powers all computational steps and storage operations on the system. ithout this mechanism, thereum would be subject to denial of service attacks, spam and would quickly grind to a halt as malicious or errant developers triggered infinite computational loops and other bad things. t was not an easy thing to eplain but luckily for us there are open minds out there.nnfter  days the enesis ale ended, and after pinching each other to see if we were dreaming, we realized thatnnwe’d touched a historical milestone.nnt’snnstill hard to believenn, but we pulled offnnthe biggestnncrowdfunding-like “one-time” initiative in the history of the nternet.nnver.nnccording to ikipedia, thereum is rated as the second-biggest crowdfunded projectnnin the history of the nternetnn– sitting proudly net to the first occupant that raised over $ mil, but over the course of years, not  days.nnf younntake a look at the listnn think one of the most important things to observe is the nature of the project and the amount of support put into it. ure, we’ve seen gadgets, consoles and video games raising millions in the past – but this time it’s about something serious and game-changing.nnore precisely, a wiss-based non-profit, bootstrapped via crypto creating an open source, blockchain-based platform for building the net nternet and gifting it to the world.nnight after this monumental achievement, things got even bigger. aul rody () was tweeting openly about  forking thereum and playing with it fornntheir vision of the nternet of hingsnn. t was certainly an eciting announcement and made some people look at thereum with different eyes .nnoving forward, the autumn of  was a dev team tour de force, both in terms of coding and in operations. y ctober the erlin hub was operational and hacking hard, with the operations ramping up at an incredible rate, with ctober th marking the release of our o .nnt was a big release for a number of reasons, one of the highlights being the blockchain speed. he block time was decreased from  seconds to  seconds, using a new -based protocol that epanded upon our previous efforts at reducing the block time to  seconds. ut that was not all before the month ended, on the th we touched another milestone – the firstnnwhisper-basednn was live.nnn ovember rd we hit another "world's first" milestone – thennworld's first thereum alloween costumenn, created by a community member ) eanwhile, by ovember th thennmsterdam hub was also operationalnnand ready to “go go go”.nnhe month of ovember peaked with italik edging out ark uckerberg to receive the orld echnology wards prize fornnthe most innovative software in nnand continuing with the first thereum developer conference   and a parallel hackathon on transparency organized in the anton of eneva.nnn the finals of the orld echnology event, italik facednnfour other nomineesnn ack/aura angermond, hristian anng, ira adinsky and (drums in the background) ark uckerberg. owever, thereum is innovation on a whole different level and apparently we are not the only ones thinking so.nnn a way, this event felt similar to the hiel ellowship t was yet another official acknowledgement regarding the innovative potential this technology has. side from this,  think it's also proof that there are many entrepreneurs and innovators out there keeping a close eye onnn#ethereumnn.nnhe hackathon on transparency was held on ovember th and was organized bynnrofessor ean enry orinnnandnntephan ualnnatnn enevann, with the main topic being "rebooting public administration & democracy".nn diverse group of about  people attended the event and we split the presentation in two rooms – one for less-technical people and one for those that brought their laptops looking to build things on thereum.nnfter the presentation  gave with aylor ended, we mied the participants and started the brainstorming session, with everyone thinking about cool ways in which blockchains can be used for transparency in public administration.nnll in all it was a great success, the night ending with rofessor orin attending a roundtable discussion with the anton of eneva on transparency and the advantages blockchain technologies like thereum bring on this front.nnthereum  was tremendously productive, and necessary, as it allowed us to have nearly all of the developers together and really get to know each other, disseminate a lot of information and chat over a lot of ideas.nnive days of back-to-back presentations, coding and thereum discussions synced the distributed team members on the same wavelength. ou can read a really nice recap of the conferencennherennand watch the presentations givennnherenn.nnefore ovember ended, we also launched a community survey andnnthe results were fantasticnn. t felt good to know that the community is with us, appreciating the work put into making this happen. fter all, the project would be nothing without an awesome community to take things forward after the launch and we're all aware of it.nnecember brought new team members, the release of the roof of oncept  and new projects such as thennnetwork intelligence dashboardnn. n the ecember th the first whisper was sent between o & ++ implementations. o one in between heard a thing )nnn the background, the security audits were about to get started, so the thereum stress-testing team was formed. ogether with the security auditors, they help us reveal weaknesses inside the system for fiing. o date, no show-stopping flaws have been found and the audits are progressing nicely.nnn anuary  we launched the o  and  met with the guys from  and amsung at  where they werennshowing what they’ve built with thereumnn. t was both amazing and encouraging to see a few proof of concepts built in such a short time using thereum, even if at the time it was in a crude state.nnanuary also brought the launch of ournnbug bounty programnn, looking to encourage people from all around the world to poke at our code and epose the things that might have escaped our eyes and minds. n sum,  anuary was a month of constant progress and optimizations with a few events spicing things up here and there.nnebruary brought the release of the o  release,nnthe first hisper group chat inside nn(our thereum browser), and an increasing attention on the enesis launch and the future plans at project level.nnthereum was also recently asked to join thennorld ide eb onsortiumnn() and participate in thenneb ayments nterest roupnn. he membership includes some of the largest banks, payments companies, tech companies and telecomsnnin the worldnn.nnthereum had a strong presence at the most recent meeting of the group (eb –) in trecht and is likely to have significant input into crafting the designs proposed, use cases built and standards forged by this committee.nnhe ultimate goal of the eb ayments roup is to deliver the payments component of the  spec. he road toward the ultimate release of that spec and incorporation by the browser manufacturers will be paved by the design, eecution and refinement of many use cases, and thereum will both lead that development effort and serve as the leading candidate technology for much of it.nnelow you can see the group picture taken at the last  organized in trecht, withnnoseph ubinnnandnninay uptannsitting on the right of the table.nnarch started with a series of announcements regarding the enesis aunch and intense work sessions of roof of oncept .nninay uptannwrote a comprehensive article where henneplained the codenames and what they meannnfor both users and developers, while avin hasnnstarted documentingnnthe development for the multi-phase thereum launch.nnll in all, it looks like an etremely busy and eciting period is coming for thereum.nno…here we are, today, one year after we settled in our wiss  – days away from launching the thereum network. e’ve gone from a few guys trying to figure out how to bootstrap this project to a worldwide movement of thousands of people, over  meetups in  countries, hundreds of amazing volunteers and a world-class core team of over  members.nne’re now a planetary community of people learning, sharing and co-creating at light-speed.nnpic.nnnd things haven't even started yet.
