Titre: Onward from the Hard Fork\nAuteur: Vitalik Buterin\nDate: July 26, 2016\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/26/onward-from-the-hard-fork\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe foundation has committed to support the community consensus on the admittedly difficult hard fork decision. eeing the results of various metrics, including carbonvote, dapp and ecosystem infrastructure adoption, this means that we will focus our resources and attention on the chain which is now called  (ie. the fork chain). hat said, we recognize that the thereum code can be used to instantiate other blockchains with the same consensus rules, including testnets, consortium and private chains, clones and spinoffs, and havennnever been opposednnto such instantiations.nnll users who had  before block  now have both  (the fork chain) and  (the community effort to continue the no-fork chain). sers are generally advised that most thereum client defaults, including clients developed by the oundation and by third parties (eg. arity), will select the  chain if you are offered a choice on a fork in the ist interface, then selecting "es" on this choice will direct you to this chain.nnsers who are interested in taking any actions with their , including creating and participating in applications, converting to another asset, etc are advised to usennthe splitter contractnnat addressnnabbbbaeadannto move their  to a separate newly created account so as to avoid replay attacks we also encourage the  community to consider adopting a secondary hard fork to change transaction formats to make further replay attacks impossible. ntil and unless that happens, once  and  are "split" they should be managed via separate wallets.nno use the splitter contract from inside of the thereum allet, click on ontracts - atch ontract, copy the address and  from the above linked etherscan page, and click "" then, click on the contract in the ontracts tab, select "rite to ontract", and select the "plit" function. t will ask for two addresses for the first, put the address where you want your  to go (feel free to put the same address you are sending from), for the second put the address where you want the  to go. ake sure to try this with a very small amount of ether first to verify that it works before increasing the amount. ou may use thennthereum lassic plorer herennto verify that  balances have been transferred.  more detailed community-provided guide can be foundnnherenn.
