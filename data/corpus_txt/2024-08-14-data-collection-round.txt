catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe codev oordinators team at  announces the  recipients of the ata ollection grant round, with a total funding amount of , . fter reviews, the winners were selected based on their innovative approaches to advancing data collection and analysis within the thereum ecosystem.nnhe selected projects span a variety of initiatives, including developing open-source data platforms, creating comprehensive dashboards and analytical tools, establishing network baselines for healthy ecosystems, and understanding the distribution and evolution of the thereum ecosystem. hese projects aim to enhance the efficiency, security, and applicability of data collection across different domains.nne look forward to the contributions of these projects, anticipating advancements that will benefit the thereum ecosystem and the broader field of data analysis.nnroject_amennompanynnroject_escriptionnnpibara open-source data platformnnpibarannhis project aims to add thereum data (ecution + onsensus ayer) to pibara, an open-source data platform.  pibara allows developers and researchers to synchronize any onchain data to a target database or . urrently, we provide support for ostgre, ongo, arquet, and webhooks. t is easy to add support for more integrations.  pibara focuses on "online" usage first, it backfills data and then synchronises it as the chain moves forward. evelopers can access the data using the tools they already know.  ur data synchronization protocol is chain-independent. or this reason, we can support indeing ecution ayer and onsensus ayer data.nnoticsnnnton ahrstätternnotics is a collection of dashboards, data and tools for thereum.  rom a dashboad side,  plan to also build one focusing on  blobs, usage of blobs, as well as incoprorating blobs into mevboost.pics.  dditionally, there are open-source data sets that  maintain.  astly, my parser for parsing the , , -oost (ids and ayloads), as well as other stuff will be open-source soon. urrently in the final testing stage. he final parser will have a simple  allowing everyone to parse the data wanted as simple as possible. urthermore the parser directly labels validators with their respective entities (ido, oinbase, ect.), marks potentially censorable transactions and  deposits. he parser can be plugged into a node and is ready to go.nnealthy etwork aselinesnnetrikannhe problem we aim to solve is establishing clear metrics and thresholds to define a healthy thereum network. iven thereum’s dynamic, decentralized nature, the responsibility for monitoring and preserving its health falls upon the entire community. o accomplish this, the community needs to agree on network health indicators, including the specific metrics that should be tracked and the corresponding thresholds that signal potential issues when the network is veering toward an unhealthy state. y leveraging atu, we will establish robust health baselines for thereum's peer-to-peer () network layer. ur goal is to document our findings, rationale, and detailed descriptions of the selected metrics, empowering the community with the knowledge to safeguard thereum's stability and well-being.nnigaabs ata collectionnnigaabsnnhe thereum blockchain is constantly evolving. t has changed dramatically in the past, with the transition from roof of work to proof of stake, and it will substantially change in the future, with the arrival of   and others. nderstanding those changes and anticipating  possible bottlenecks is the main job of blockchain researchers. ut for that we need a vast array of tools, in order to collect massive amounts of data, etract information from it, analyze the observed patterns and visualize them in an intuitive way. he goal of this ambitious project is to develop and enhance the tools for monitoring thereum nodes, keep track of data propagation, discover the nodes in the network, unveil patterns in , eplore the limits of  technology, monitor devnets and feature forks, follow validator performance and visualize all this data in a clear and insightful fashion.nnllowing validators to provide client information privatelynnethermindnnnderstanding the distribution of thereum’s eecution-layer and consensus-layer clients used by validators is vital to ensure a resilient and diverse network. lthough there are currently methods to estimate the eacon hain’s client distribution among validators, the same cannot be said about eecution client distribution. lso, there is no standard means of anonymously showcasing which s and s are being utilized. his proposal aims to research and design a way to submit and etract this crucial data while potentially avoiding compromising user anonymity and network performance.nnnonymous alidator ata ollection using nnbhishek umarnnhere are close to k validators on ethereum mainnet. his translates to a treasure trove of data about validators that is waiting to be captured. his data would allow us to better design the ethereum protocol by understanding the pain points. ut the hard fact is that we don’t have enough data on these validators. ure, we have data dashboards like rated.network but they are incomplete. or eample, we don’t have information about what clients the ethereum node is using (reth, nimbus, teku), on what machine (arm/linu) etc.  alidator operators don’t wish to epose too much information on their staking setups. his is the problem that we’re trying to solve. e plan to use  for data collection that allows validator operators to provide information while staying anonymous.nnore latform pansionnnrowthepienngrowthepie has a solid foundation providing reliable ayer  data and blockspace analysis as well as content for end-users, developers, and investors. ur aim is to provide our users with the most neutral and complete curated set of metrics, tools and knowledge to understand the ever-growing  space and make the ecosystem more transparent. or this, we aim to epand the feature set of the platform, to list more thereum ayer s, to include more metrics, blockspace analysis and knowledge content. ll this while staying public goods funded, keeping a reliable infrastructure for high demand as well as a responsive and quick user eperience.nntandardised and rowdsourced mart ontract abels & snnrowthepiennhis proposal addresses the issue of isolated and non-standardised contract labelling datasets within the blockchain data community. y introducing a standardised data model for smart contract labels, inclusive of , we advocate for the consolidation into a single, universally accessible database utilised by various data providers. ur solution etends beyond standardisation, adding the community as a key entity into the labelling effort. e have identified that the long-term success of a comprehensive label database relies on crowdsourcing from the community, achieved by lowering the entry barriers with more user-friendly front ends and open  endpoints for seamless integration. his approach marks a pivotal shift for smart contract labels towards a community-driven, standardised and eventual decentralised public good.nnconomic analysis of snnethermindnnhe rapid adoption of ayer  solutions (s) necessitates a clear understanding of the profitability and data requirements of the new chains. e aim to develop tooling to provide data for the calldata costs of s and the fee that the  networks pay for  security.  he size of the calldata costs will also help study the dynamics of . e hope to provide insight into the data requirements of the epected largest consumer of blob space.  he analysis of the profitability and current costs of the rollups will give all of the rollups vital information to design competitive gas markets and increase the information available to consumers of the rollups to allow them to make informed choices about the architectures they rely on. his, coupled with our other proposal on rollup security, will provide consumers a strong basis to select rollup services at a known cost and risk.  he data will also be effective for modelling and predicting the behaviour of the data blob market in thereum. ccording tonnthe paper by ffchain abs and the thereum oundationnnwe assume that the top five rollups by  will be classified as a ‘large roll-up’ in the near future and that their data posting strategy will be to use -. e can compute what the historical cost of  would have been assuming the rollups used  from their geneses and try to predict the market dynamics of  in the near future, according to the rollups’ current and epected usages.  inally we will propose a standard for comparing and benchmarking the computational capacity between  and non- chains.nnnalysis of  inality and conomics of  ecuritynnethermindnnhe rapid adoption of ayer  solutions (s) necessitates a clear understanding of the associated risks for developers and users alike. e aim to develop tooling to provide real-time data and assess these risks across various s. he tooling will address the risk of  networks forking from their  canonical chain, and  blocks not finalising on .  real-time asset risk tracking feature will also quantify and display the assets at risk, providing a clear view of financial eposure. hrough this tooling and associated dashboard, we strive to improve transparency and understanding in the  ecosystem, fostering a safer and more informed community while encouraging s to push for the economic security they require.nnalletabelsnn- tandardizing & nriching thereum ccount abels for ransparency and tilitynnunction absnnalletabels is a platform that simplifies the identification of on-chain wallets through custom labels. he need for clear, accessible, and actionable insights into wallet behaviors becomes more and more important as the space grows and matures. ur intuitive interface lets users easily search and categorize wallet addresses by name, label, or entity type, transforming anonymous hashes into meaningful insights. e envision offering a labeling infrastructure that etends its value across a broad spectrum of platforms—be it block eplorers, wallet services, or consumer-oriented applications.
