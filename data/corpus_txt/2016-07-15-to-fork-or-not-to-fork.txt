Titre: To fork or not to fork\nAuteur: Jeffrey Wilcke\nDate: July 15, 2016\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/15/to-fork-or-not-to-fork\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe , though not a product developed by the thereum oundation, has been a hot topic as of late, both internally in the organisation as well as within our community. he ard ork is a delicate topic and the way we see it, no decision is the right one. s this is not a decision that can be made by the foundation or any other single entity, we again turn towards the community to assess its wishes in order to provide the most appropriate protocol change.nnhe specification proposed for the hard fork that is being implemented in the eth client is as followsnnhe  (nnbbbcdfdefcccdbbcnn), its etraalance (nnafaccfcdfbeeaacann), all children of the  creator (nnaceaeabeadfcnn) and the etrabalance of each child are encoded into a list  at block . he contents of  can be viewednnherenn. t the beginning of block  (  , on uly  or  depending on your time zone), all ether throughout all accounts in  will be transferred to contract account , which is at (nnbfedbfdeddddbcann). ou can verify the solidity source code of  onnnetherscannn. rom this contract,  token holders can submit their  in order to withdraw  at a rate of     . he etrabalance, as well as some additional ether that remains due to complications in the interactions between the re-entrancy eploit and the splitting mechanism, will be withdrawable by the  curator to be distributed as appropriate to cover all edge cases.nndditional information to facilitate verification of the fork spec and implementation is epected to be released separately by the community consensus code in eth that implements the fork logic is covered by the bugnnbounty programnn.nnnfortunately time limits require swift adoption before a protocol change becomes impractical. he community toolnncarbonvotennwill be used to set the default fork option for eth. t block number  the votes will be tallied, and the outcome will determine whether the default is setnnto forknnornnnot to forknn. hen merging thenn fork snnwill proceednn, followed shortly by a release for both eth and ist. sers with business-critical applications who need to update quickly should frequently check the blog and social media for ongoing updates.
