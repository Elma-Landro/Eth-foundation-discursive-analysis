Titre: On Wave 1 and Devcon Ticketing\nAuteur: Devcon Team\nDate: Team on July 15, 2019\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/07/15/on-wave-one-and-devcon-ticketing\nCat√©gorie: Non cat√©goris√©\n\n==================================================\n\ny now, we hope you've heard the newsnnn just two days, on uly , , the first wave of general evcon tickets will go online at am  / am  / pm  / pm nn.nnoday, we wanted to bring everyone a few details on the ticketing process in advance of ednesday's launch.nns always, we're working to ensure everyone has a fair chance to attend evcon, so ticket purchases are limited to  per order, and passes cannot be bulk-reserved. urther, we've maintained our limit of  tickets per organization to help as many teams as possible join us in saka.nnaves have been a bit of a rush in the past, but we've made changes to work toward a smoother process. e're working through scholarship, builder, speaker, sponsor, and student applications early so that only those that need to purchase general admission tickets will participate in the public waves. urther, there will be more ticketing waves to come following this week's release.nne're also really ecited to have made the move to an open source ticketing platform this year. e've had to put in some work to get it ready for the volume of tickets we sell and the particularities of evcon, but we think it has really paid off. ot only is it more in line with our values to use this libre platform along with community-developed plugins, but we've also been able to add some fun customizations including a  (bring your own badge) option and the ability to opt-in to swag. wag opt-in will both guarantee you'll the get the items you're most ecited about, and allow us to cut down on waste by not overproducing.nninally, we wanted to re-share and updated bit of relevant information from last year's blog on how our decisions are made to help create a welcoming and transparent process.nnicket istribution and evenue llocationnnirst up ore than two thirds of evcon tickets are (still) either discounted or free, and geared toward builders and students among other groups. he remaining tickets are sold through a series of "waves" at about the same rate per ticket as the previous three evcon events (a few ‚Ç¨ cheaper this year) -- this covers the cost of the conference and any profits go towards operations at the thereum oundation. his in turn lets us use our financial resources to give back to the community through funding core development and providing ecosystem grants. dditionally, scholarships and sponsorships from community leaders enable us to bring participants to saka who would otherwise be unable to attend, and to release the majority of tickets at discounted prices.nnavesnnaves are the way for anyone to purchase a general admission ticket. e are spacing out the timing of the waves so that we can apply the lessons we learn into future waves (i.e. fiing bugs, addressing up-time issues).nnoming oon!nnoon after the completion of this week's wave, stay tuned for more from us about the net ticket releases, as well as the first news on speakers and the timing of the final window for talk submissions.nninally, we're always open to your ideas and feedback to make this process better.nno stay tuned for future evcon updates, follow eva the evcon nicorn (nnevconnn) or keep posted to the thereum oundation log here.nnü¶Ñnndevcon team
