Titre: FAQ: Upcoming Ethereum Hard Fork\nAuteur: Hudson Jameson\nDate: Jameson on October 18, 2016\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/10/18/faq-upcoming-ethereum-hard-fork\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe thereum network will be undergoing a hard fork at block number , which will likely occur between  and   on uesday, ctober , .  countdown timer can be seen atnnhttps//fork.codetract.io/nn.nns a user, what do  need to donnownload the latest version of your thereum clientnnatest version of thereum allet/ist (v..)nnatest geth client (v..)nnatest arity client (v..)nnatest ethereum client (v..)nnhat happens if  do not participate in the hard forknnf you are using an thereum client that is not updated for the upcoming hard fork, your client will sync to the pre-fork blockchain once the fork occurs. ou will be stuck on an incompatible chain following the old rules and you will be unable to send ether or operate on the post-fork thereum network.nnhat is a hard fork in thereum-landnn hard fork is a change to the underlying thereum protocol, creating new rules to improve the system. ll thereum clients need to upgrade otherwise they will be stuck on an incompatible chain following the old rules. he decentralized nature of blockchain systems makes a hard fork upgrade more difficult. ard forks in a blockchain require cooperation and communication with the community, as well as with the developers of the various thereum clients in order for the transition to go smoothly.nnhat happens during a hard forknnfter consensus is reached on what changes should be included in a hard fork, changes to the protocol are written into the various thereum clients, such as geth, arity, and ethereum. he protocol changes are activated at a specific block number. ny nodes that have not been upgraded to the new ruleset will be abandoned on the old chain where the previous rules continue to eist.nnhy do we need a hard forknnince eptember th (), the thereum network has been under attack by a person or group resulting in large delays before transactions were processed. he network is currently filled with pending transactions which is causing users delays in processing their transactions. ou can think of this as a denial of service (o) attack on the thereum blockchain.nnvery operation that an thereum contract performs on the network is given a price or gas fee. sing the  operation is less computationally epensive than performing a comple operation such as hashing a number using . he attacker performed a o attack by repeatedly calling certain operation codes (opcodes) in their smart contracts that are computationally difficult for clients to process, but very cheap to add to the network. n order to prevent the attacker(s) from continuing to flood the network with low-priced contracts with high computational cost, we are raising the price of certain operations.nnhy are we doing two hard forks and what will the effects bennhe two hard forks each address different problems that have arisen from the attacks. he first hard fork is meant to address urgent network health issues concerning underpriced operation codes. s described in thereum mprovement roposal , “  ard ork,” the first hard fork is set to occur at block number  and will adjust the price of underpriced opcodes involved in the attack. he second hard fork is epected to address a number of less urgent matters such as removing empty accounts which the attacker used to flood the thereum network, and which caused the size of the blockchain to inflate. he second hard fork is still being discussed.nnfter the second hard fork has been implemented, there will likely be a “clean-up period” during which time there may continue to be delays and difficulties processing transactions and syncing until the blockchain state has been fully debloated.nnow will the   hard fork affect contractsnnee following commentarynnhttps//www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/pbv/a_quick_note_on_how_the_call_gas_cost_increase/nnhere can  find more technical details on what the two new hard forks will change in the protocolnnhe respective changes to thereum protocol are documented in the itub repository fornnthereum mprovement roposalsnnhe following two s describe the current plans for the upcoming hard forksnn  version c “ong-term gas cost changes for -heavy operations to mitigate transaction spam attacks”nn  “tate clearing”nn big thanks to the thereum community for their patience and understanding, and to all thereum developers across all clients and platforms who came together to provide input, thoughts, and contributions to address stopping the attacks and helping to improve the platform.
