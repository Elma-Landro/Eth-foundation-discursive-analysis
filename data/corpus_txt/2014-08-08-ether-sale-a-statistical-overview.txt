Titre: Ether Sale: A Statistical Overview\nAuteur: Vitalik Buterin\nDate: August 8, 2014\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/08/ether-sale-a-statistical-overview\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe first two weeks of the ether sale are over, and we have to date receivednnover  nnfrom selling over  million . his marks the largest cryptographic token sale to date, and with the two endowments places  as being the token with thennth highest total valuenn, even beating out the beloved ogecoin atnn.nnnnnnnnnnvnnsnn.  vsnn.nnnnnnnnnnvnnsnn..  total of  transactions have been made, with values ranging from the minimum .  to a high of  , and purchases continue to come in every hour. dditionally, the ether sale marks the largest use of multisig to date because of our sale, thennpercentage of all  stored in multisignnhas shot up from .% to .% over the last two weeks alone - in other words, the -of- private keys split between our various sites control % of all  stored in multisig addresses in eistence.nnhe purpose of this post will be to provide an overview of some statistics from the sale so far. ata was taken yesterday, when we had  , and assumes that all purchases were for   /  (an assumption that is not strictly true, but the error term is sufficiently tiny that it can safely be discounted). irst we havennthis spreadsheetnn, which shows the ether purchases over time.nnhe individual spikes are per-block the chart shows that the distribution is heavily divided into two clusters, with one cluster closer to the start of the sale and the other close to the end of the full-discount period. urchases drop off sharply once the new price level of  / (now  /) kicked in. heoretically, purchasing near the end of the full-discount period is the more optimal strategy from a naive game-theoretic model if you purchase near the end of the full-discount period then you get the same price as people who purchased at the start, but also gain the benefit of having more information - namely, a better idea of the eact percentage of all  that you are going to get. hus, the fact that the majority of purchases occurred at the end shows that ether purchasers are generally a rather sophisticated audience - which  suppose you should be if you managed to be convinced to trade your hard-earned  for some cryptographic tokens backed by a concept of "generalized consensus computing".nnf course, it is important to note that there are reasons to buy at the start too. ome people are participating in the sale out of a desire to support the project, and some large purchasers may have perhaps had thennpriming effectnnin mind, where putting larger sums of money (eg. bills) into a tipping jar at the very beginning increases the total amount received because it creates the impression that the recipient is significant and merits more and larger contributions.nnt this point, we can epect to see a declining flow that will stabilize over the net few days, and then a smaller final spike on day . he chart below shows the cumulative ether sold up until this pointnnhttps//docs.google.com/a/ethereum.org/spreadsheets/d/wpeovczzalig/gviz/chartiframeoidnnhe other interesting thing to analyze is the distribution of purchases.nnhis spreadsheetnncontains a list of purchases arranged by purchase size. he largest single purchase was   ( million ether), followed by one at   (, ) and   (, ). e have not received any requests atnnlargepurchasesethereum.orgnn. f we arrange purchases by size, we get the following two graphs, one for the quantity of purchases and one for the amount of  purchased, by purchase sizennhttps//docs.google.com/a/ethereum.org/spreadsheets/d/pzdlr_aoiriqyvntm/gviz/chartiframeoidnnhttps//docs.google.com/a/ethereum.org/spreadsheets/d/pzdlr_aoiriqyvntm/gviz/chartiframeoidnnote that this only applies to purchases. here is also another slice of ether which will soon be distributed, which is the endowment. he portions in which the endowment is planned to be distributed are onnnthe spreadsheetnn the largest is equal to .% of all ether purchased (ie. .% of the total supply after five years) and the smallest is .%, with  people total receiving a share. f you are one of the recipients, you will be contacted shortly if you are not then there is still a second slice whose distribution has not been decided.nnistribution and ini ndicesnns a final set of interesting statistics, we have calculated three ini indicesnnini inde of ether purchasers .nnini inde of endowment .nnini inde of entire set .nn ini inde is a common measure of inequality the way the ini inde is calculated is by drawing a chart, with both aes going from % to %, and drawing a line where the  coordinate at a particular  coordinate is calculated as the portion of all income (or wealth) which is owned by the bottom  percent of the population. he area between this curve and a diagonal line, as a portion of the area of the entire triangle under the diagonal line, is the ini indennn an ideal society of perfect equality, the coefficient would be zero the bottom % of the population would obviously have % of the wealth, just like any other % of the population, so the cumulative wealth distribution graph would be eactly the diagonal line and thus the area between the graph and the diagonal line would be zero. n the opposite scenario, an ultimate dictatorship where one person controls everything, the bottom % would have eactly nothing all the way up until the last person, who would have everything hence, the area between that curve and the diagonal line would be equal to the entire area under the diagonal line, and the coefficient would be eactly one. ost real-world scenarios are in between the two.nnote that ini coefficients of wealth and ini coefficients of income are different things one measures how much people have and one measures the rate at which people receive. ecausennsavings are superlinear in incomenn, coefficients of wealth tend to be higher the ini coefficient of wealth in the , for eample,nnis .nn, and the coefficient of the world is .. iven that ini coefficients in the real world measure inequality of access to resources, and ini coefficients in cryptocurrency distribution arise from both inequality of resources and inequality of interest (some people care about thereum slightly, some care about it a whole lot), . is a pretty decent result - as a point of comparison, the ini coefficient of itcoin has beennnmeasured at .nn. he top  current  holders are responsible for .% of all , a lower percentage than the top  holdersnnof the mainstream altcoinsnn, where that statistic tends to be between % and %.nnf course, these last two comparisons are misleading - the thereum ecosystem has not even started to actually run, and services like echanges which centralize control over currency units into a few wallets without centralizing legal ownership do end up artificially inflating both the ini inde and the top- score of cryptocurrency networks that are actually live. nce thereum launches, the ini inde may well prove to be impossible to accurately estimate, since large quantities of ether will be stored inside decentralized applications running arbitrary, uring-complete, and thusnnin many cases mathematically inscrutablenn, rulesets for how the ether can be withdrawn.nnhe sale still has  days left to go although we are not epecting much out of this remaining period, anything is possible. ith organizational issues being wrapped up, the organization is getting ready to substantially scale up development, putting us on the fast track to finally completing the thereum code and launching the genesis block  winter -.
