cat√©goris√©\n\n==================================================\n\nhe thereum network will be undergoing a scheduled upgrade atnnblock number ,,nn, which is predicted to occur onnnednesday, ecember , nn. he eact date is subject to change due to variable block times and timezones.nnlease upgrade your node before unday, ecember ,  to account for the variable block times.nnhat is rrow laciernnhe rrow lacier network upgrade, similarly tonnuir laciernn, changes the parameters of the ce ge/ifficulty omb, pushing it back several months. his has also been done in the yzantium, onstantinople and ondon network upgrades. o other changes are introduced as part of rrow lacier.nnhe difficulty bomb only affects roof of ork networks, and hence only eists on the thereum mainnet and the opsten test network. ith thennrecent progressnntowards thereum's transition to roof of take, it was decided to only delay the bomb on mainnet for now and to try and run the roof of take transition on opsten before the bomb goes off on that network.nno learn more about rrow lacier and the history of the difficulty bomb, see the thereum at erders'nneplainer blog postnn.nnlient ersionsnnn order to be compatible with the rrow lacier upgrade, node operators will need to update the client version that they run to one of the ones listed belownnlientnnersion umbernnownload inknngo-ethereum

support for rrow lacier under version number ..-rc., which you can downloadnnherenn.nnor now, we still recommend following the prior deprecation warnings and selecting an alternative client software. f you choose to use  for the rrow lacir upgrade, please eercise caution and independently review changes to the codebase prior to running in production.nnpgrade pecification and snnhe full specification for the upgrade can be found in thenneecution-specsnnrepositorynnherenn.nn single  is included in the upgradenn- ifficulty omb elay to une nn.nns an thereum user or ether holder is there anything  need to donnf you use an echange, a web wallet service, a mobile wallet service, or a hardware wallet you do not need to do anything unless you are informed to take additional steps by your echange or wallet service.nns a node operator or miner, what do  need to donnownload the latest version of your thereum client, as listed in the table above.nnhat happens if  am a miner or node operator and  do not participate in the upgradennf you are using an thereum client that is not updated to the latest version (listed above), your client will sync to the pre-fork blockchain once the upgrade occurs. ou will be stuck on an incompatible chain following the old rules and you will be unable to send ther or operate on the post-upgrade thereum network.nnhat is a network upgrade in thereum-landnn network upgrade is a change to the underlying thereum protocol, creating new rules to improve the system. he decentralized nature of blockchain systems makes a network upgrade more difficult. etwork upgrades in a blockchain require cooperation and communication with the community, as well as with the developers of the various thereum clients in order for the transition to go smoothly.nnhat happens during a network upgradennfter the community comes to an agreement concerning which changes should be included in the upgrade, changes to the protocol are written into the various thereum clients, such as geth, rigon, esu and ethermind. he protocol changes are activated at a specific block number. ny nodes that have not been upgraded to the new ruleset will be abandoned on the old chain where the previous rules continue to eist.nnhy "rrow lacier"nnhile we've recently been using evcon names for network upgrades, when we previously had an upgrade that only pushed back the bomb, we decided to switch nomenclature. o highlight the nature of the upgrade (pushing back the "ce ge"), we went with a glacier name, hence uir lacier.nnhis upgrade follows a similar pattern. ecause the transition to roof of take is on the horizon, a retreating glacier was chosen, hence rrow lacier üèî!nnhank ou!nn big thanks to the thereum community and to all thereum developers across all clients and platforms who come together to provide input, thoughts, and contributions. his might be the last network upgrade on thereum before the transition to roof of take. et's go!nnlso, many thanks tonnarshil udkannfor the cover image.nnhis is an emergent and evolving highly technical space. f you choose to implement the recommendations in this post and continue to participate, you should
