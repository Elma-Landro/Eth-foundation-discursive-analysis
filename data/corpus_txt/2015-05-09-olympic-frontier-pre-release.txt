Titre: Olympic: Frontier Pre-Release\nAuteur: Vitalik Buterin\nDate: May 9, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/05/09/olympic-frontier-pre-release\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhat began all the way back on midnight of ebruary st , is coming to a close we are happy to announce the release of the ninth and last in the thereum roof-of-oncept series.  e invite the community to participate in the ongoing roof-of-oncept  testnet in our present release, lympic,nnmade available now.nnhe purpose of lympic is to reward people who try to test the limits of the thereum blockchain during the pre-release period, spamming the network with transactions and doing crazy things with the state, so that we can see how the network holds up under high levels of load. t the same time, application developers, data providers, echanges, and users are encouraged to develop and deploy on the testnet and run nodes - and if you have multiple virtual private servers, spin up as many nodes as you can.nnlympic will feature a total prize fund of up to , ether. here will be four categories of prize as well as a grand prize for the first person to create a substantial fork on the testnet.nnhe four categories of prize will bennransaction ctivitynn,nnirtual achine sagenn,nnining rowessnnandnneneral unishmentnn. ach category will include a main prize of , ether, as well as one or more smaller prizes at  - , ether and possibly tiny rewards of .- ether simply for participating. ach of the categories will be judged by italik, avin and eff, likely with substantial help from automated blockchain analysis tools. n addition to the ther, like the bounty programme, all prize-winners will be entitled to have their name immortalised in the thereum enesis block. lease note that to be considered for a prize, send an e-mail describing a claim to olympicethereum.org.nnhis is also the last phase of the thereum development process before the rontier release, as the network is currently proving to be highly stable at its current size of - nodes, all major clients have been staying in consensus and we are approaching code freeze pending testing and auditing inputs.nnt is epected to last close to  days, though we reserve the right to shorten or lengthen it based on technical considerations. hen we deem that we are ready, we will provide a  hour countdown for the rontier . launch.nninaries and source are available herennhttps//github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v..nn work-in-progress guide to rontier is available herennhttp//ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/nnransaction ctivitynnhis includes activity related to sending and receiving transactions. amples of things we might reward includennhe account that sends the highest total number of transactionsnnhe account that contributes the highest total of gas usagennhe account that receives the highest total number of transactionsnnhe account that contributes the highest bloat (as measured in bytes) to the blockchain in terms of transaction trie contentsnnhe account with the lowest address (in terms of leicographic order or numerical representation the two orders are equivalent) that sends at least one transactionnnhe two accounts that send at least one transaction whose addresses are closest to each othernnirtual achine sagennhis includes activity relating to using the virtual machine. amples of things we might reward includennhe account that makes the highest number of calls of any opcodennhe account that makes the highest number of calls of any opcode within a single transactionnnhe account that sends the single transaction that takes the longest for a particular client to eecutennhe account that sends the single transaction with the highest ratio of time to eecute per unit gas consumednnhe account that receives the highest total number of messagesnnhe account that reverts the highest total amount of gas usagennhe account that creates the contract with the lowest address (in terms of leicographic order or numerical representation the two orders are equivalent)nnhe account that sends the transaction with the largest (as measured in bytes) encoded receipt nnhe account that produces the largest number of transactions whose bloom is a (distinct) prime numbernn creator of a contract that contains, for eample, a sudoku solver, taking an array of  values as input and outputting the array of  values corresponding to a solved sudokunnining rowessnnhis includes activity relating to mining miners will be identified by coinbase address. amples of things we might reward includennhe miner that produces the largest block in the main chain (as measured in bytes)nnhe miner that contributes the largest total number of bytes of block data to the main chainnnhe miner that mines the largest number of blocks in a rownnhe miner that includes the most transactionsnnhe miner that produces the block that takes the longest amount of time for a particular client to processnneneral unishmentnnhis includes mucking around with the tate in crazy ways, getting contracts to do crazy things. amples of things we might reward includennhe sender/miner of the transaction/block that adds the largest number of items to contract storagennhe creator of the contract with the largest code (eternally-owned accounts only)nnhe creator of the contract with the most filled items in storagennhe creator of the contract that contains a key/value pair with the highest merkle tree depth (ie. the largest number of hash lookups before getting to the value)nnhe creator of the contract that suicides while containing the most filled items in storagennhe creator of the contract that makes the largest number of consecutive storage updates such that the storage root at each step is a prime number.nnote that the above categories are by no means an ehaustive list of things that are eligible for prizes. f you do anything outside of the above that you feel merits consideration, please email us.nnhe rand rizenn grand prize of at least , ether will be shared between the miner(s) who manage to create a substantial fork between the o and ++ clients. he fork must be on the main chain one client must accept the block with the other client rejecting it. maller prizes for forks between o/++ and ython may also be available.nnood luck, and we look forward to seeing and hearing what you all come up with!nn- he ethereum core dev team
