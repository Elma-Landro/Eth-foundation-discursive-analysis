erlin is wherennevcon nntook place, and the net upgrade will be called ondon, where evcon  happened.nns an thereum user or ther holder, is there anything  need to donnf you use an echange (such as oinbase, raken, or inance), a web wallet service (such as etamask, yrypto, or ytherallet), a mobile wallet service (such as oinbase allet, tatus.im, or rust allet), or a hardware wallet (such as edger, rezor, or eepey) you do not need to do anything unless you are informed to take additional steps by your echange or wallet service.nns a node operator or miner, what do  need to donnownload the latest version of your thereum client, as listed in the table above.nnhat happens if  am a miner or node operator and  do not participate in the upgradennf you are using an thereum client that is not updated to the latest version (listed above), your client will sync to the pre-fork blockchain once the upgrade occurs. ou will be stuck on an incompatible chain following the old rules and you will be unable to send ther or operate on the post-upgrade thereum network.nnhat is a network upgrade in thereum-landnn network upgrade is a change to the underlying thereum protocol, creating new rules to improve the system. he decentralized nature of blockchain systems makes a network upgrade more difficult. etwork upgrades in a blockchain require cooperation and communication with the community, as well as with the developers of the various thereum clients in order for the transition to go smoothly.nnhat happens during a network upgradennfter the community comes to an agreement concerning which changes should be included in the upgrade, changes to the protocol are written into the various thereum clients, such as geth, pen thereum, esu and ethermind. he protocol changes are activated at a specific block number. ny nodes that have not been upgraded to the new ruleset will be abandoned on the old chain where the previous rules continue to eist.nnhank ou!nn big thanks to the thereum community and to all thereum developers across all clients and platforms who came together to provide input, thoughts, and contribution for erlin üòÅüá©üá™nnow, onto ondon üá¨üáß!nnisclaimernnhis is an emergent and evolving highly technical space. f you choose to implement the recommendations in this post and continue to participate, you should make sure you understand how it impacts you. ou should understand that there are risks involved including but not limited to risks like unepected bugs. y choosing to implement these recommendations, you alone assume the risks of the consequences. his post and recommendations are not a sale of any kind, and do not create any warranties of any kind including but not limited to anything related to the thereum network, or the thereum clients referred to herein.
