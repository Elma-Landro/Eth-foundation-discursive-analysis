Titre: Supporting Ethereum’s Client Ecosystem\nAuteur: Ethereum Foundation Team\nDate: Team on March 23, 2021\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/23/supporting-ethereums-client-ecosystem\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nith the arrival of the beacon chain in , thereum today supports two types of clients those focusing on thenneecution-layernn(often referred to as eth) and those powering the proof-of-stakennconsensus layernn(aka eth). s those running validators are well aware (since they run both client types), each serves a specific purpose, and powers a different part of one thereum.nnecognizing the importance that both client sets represent to the long term health and network diversity of thereum, our work to support the full landscape of clients is fundamental to our work in the ecosystem.nnayer-specific client support updatesnnthe eecution-layernnn , the thereum oundation plans to allocate at least $ million  to eecution-layer client teams.nnhese grants, the first of which have been distributed, support the following client teamsnnesunn,nneth (o thereum)nn,nnethermindnn,nnpen thereumnn, andnnurbo ethnn.nnt was clear even in thereum’s early days that greater client diversity helped to strengthen thereum at its core. hat’s why we’re reaffirming our support for their work with this first step toward sustainability today.nnthe consensus-layernnn , the  is allocating at minimumnnnnmnninnlnnlnninnonnnnnnnnnnntnnonncnnonnnnnsnnennnnnsnnunnsnn−nnlnnannynnennrnncnnlnninnennnnntnnsnn.nnnnhnninnsnninnsnnannnnninnnnncnnrnnennannsnnennfnnrnnonnmnnonnunnrnnfnnunnnnndnninnnnngnninnnnnnn,nnwnnhnnennrnnennannbnnonnunntnn million  to consensus-layer clients. his is an increase from our funding in , where aboutnnnnminnllnninnonnnnnnnnnnntnnoconnnnnsennnnnsnnunnsnn−nnlnnannyercnnlnninnennnnntnnsnn.nnnnhinnsnninnsnnaninnncrennannsennfnnronnmnnonnunnrnnfnnunnnnndnninnngnninnnnn,nnwnnhnnerennabnnonnunntnn. million  was spent on client teams, as detailed in previous posts (nn  llocation pdates,nnnn,nnnn,nnnn,nnnn). dditionally, support may be announced in periodic research andnnecosystem support programnnupdates over the course of the year for audits, formal verification, testing, bug bounties, tooling and other community support.nnhe consensus-layer today has four clients,nnighthousenn,nnekunn,nnrysmnnandnnimbusnnthat are online, and which have been stable since the launch of the beacon chain in ecember. t the time of this post, these clients have enabled the beacon chain to be secured by over .mm ther, which are supplied by over , active validators. his feat, and the accomplishments of these teams to date can not be overstated. 👏nndditionally, a fifth client,nnodestarnn, has provided quality javascript tooling (which is already used by various eplorers and other beacon chain tracking tools) and other  standardization, and aims to bring beacon chain light-clients to production this year!nnur support in  will be primarily geared toward these five clients, with other opportunities possible as development progresses.nnoving forward togethernnsnnanny yan eplained in his recent inalized # postnn, “as a beacon chain staker, you need an thereum o endpoint to successfully perform all of your various duties as a validator”. his means that today and after the merge, both client types are required to power the network. nd because the eecution-layer’s familiar technology remains regardless of changes to consensus, there is no action required by dapps, developers or users to continue using thereum as they always have. n short, both client types remain necessary, and the long-term strength, health and decentralization of thereum succeeds as they succeed.nnver the last months, we’ve seen new interest and innovation on thereum, and more is surely on the horizon. s network use increases and thereum’s potential appears even more vast, the sustainable support of open source software on both layers is essential, and we look forward to providing further updates on our work in this area. 🚀
