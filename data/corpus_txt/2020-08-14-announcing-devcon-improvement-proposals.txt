Titre: Announcing Devcon Improvement Proposals (DIPs)\nAuteur: Devcon Team\nDate: Team on August 14, 2020\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/08/14/announcing-devcon-improvement-proposals\nCatÃ©gorie: Non catÃ©gorisÃ©\n\n==================================================\n\noday, we (the evcon organizing team) are ecited to make public a new way to get involved in net yearâ€™s event, and one that should make evcon an eperience that better represents thereum as a whole.nnevcon mprovement roposals (s)nnare a new tool to involve collaborative community input from across the ecosystem. hey are aimed at improving the evcon eperience by formalizing a process to get your ideas heard and integrated into the event.nnhy nownnn previous posts, weâ€™ve touched on doing more to represent the entire thereum ecosystem at evcon. owever, doing so at any one event has become more and more challenging over the years. n many ways, this is a welcome problem to have, since the challenge is thanks to the growth in both size and diversity among builders, presenters, attendees, organizations and everyone else thatâ€™s participating.nnhile there was a time when everyone involved might have easily fit into a classroom, weâ€™ve long since passed a point where demand eceeded supply in more ways than one (e.g. the amount of tickets, talk slots, or dogfooded applications).nno while we took first steps in solving for specific areas of past difficultynnin our launch post earlier this yearnn, weâ€™ve also tried to be proactive when thinking about how to factor for things that no one team might think to include on their own. nd thatâ€™s led us here.nnow do s worknnetâ€™s dig in. he best way to get started with s is by visitingnnthe  github reponnand bynnjoining the conversation over at the newnnevcon orumnn.nns a first step, we recommend posting your idea in the evcon orum to receive feedback from a wider community. nce things feel a bit more defined, you can submit a formal proposal. rom the time of a submission, youâ€™ll be able to receive feedback from our team and others to help refine ideas, to discuss how they might fit into the program, and more.nnhe process is inspired by the ,  and  processes, and while this new eperiment is a bit more centralized (in that the approval of proposals ultimately lies with the evcon team), we are ecited to have a new way to branch out and hope to find consensus on a whole bunch of newly proposed ideas. he goals of s are for everyone to feel heard, to have a more open discussion, and (most importantly) to improve the event by listening to and learning from the innovators around us.nnhat might s look likennf this process sounds rather abstract to you so far and youâ€™re wondering what s might actually look like, youâ€™re in luck! s are just being made public today, but the evcon team has been working with a few teams to trial-run the first proposals in recent weeks.nnome of our first proposals include trying tonnmake evcon carbon neutralnn, enablingnnhotel and flight bookings through a  decentralized travel marketplacenn, preparing annpermissionless treasure huntnn, and providing attendees with annsmart wallet cardnnduring the conference.nnrapping upnne know that the thereum ecosystem has simply grown too large for our team alone to be aware of every great idea out there. ith the aid of s, combined with your awesome continued involvement, we can make evcon more representative of our community than ever before.nnor more information, everyone is welcome to check outnn-nn, to take a look at the s already submitted, and to join thennforumnnto participate in new and ongoing discussions. e canâ€™t wait to hear from you!nnðŸ¦„
