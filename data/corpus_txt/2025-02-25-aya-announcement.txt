Titre: A new chapter in the infinite garden\nAuteur: Aya Miyaguchi\nDate: February 25, 2025\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/02/25/aya-announcement\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\ny dear thereum community,nnoday, ’m ecited to turn the page and share that  will be closing this chapter as ecutive irector of the thereum oundation soon and stepping into a new role as its resident. his new opportunity will allow me to continue supporting ’s institutional relationships, and to epand the reach of our vision and culture more broadly. ’m feeling deeply grateful and enthusiastic for what’s ahead, and while  made this decision a year ago, recent events have given me the perfect opportunity to reflect on what truly matters to me.nnhese past few weeks have illuminated something profound about thereum — a truth that becomes clearest in moments of tension, when debates arise over the network’s performance or ’s market value. cross the globe, teams and individuals speak of thereum as if it were their own, yet this very tension is where our greatest strength liesnnthereum belongs to everyone precisely because it belongs to no onenn. ur culture of permissionlessness doesn’t just tolerate disagreement — it grows stronger through it. nd in the midst of it all, we’ve seen new, hopeful energy emerge, reminding me that it’s often in darkness that we notice the north star—something we too often take for granted.nn’d like to borrow from tewart rand’snnace ayeringnnto eplain how  view things in thereum. e presents a framework for how the world works, which was inspired by rian no’snnhearing ayersnn. ver time, this model has shaped the thinking of a diverse group of influential people, technologists, artists, futurists, and organizations alike.nnpholding thereum's aluesnnhere does thereum fit within these layers s it in the fast-moving outer layers, where rapid eperimentation happens r at the core, where nature and culture evolve more slowly  don’t think the answer lies entirely in either. f we want thereum to be more than a short-term product, if we want it to weave into the fabric of the world for the long term, we need all layers, moving at all paces. nd if we don’t want thereum to ever be confined to a short-term product of one company, then all layers cannot—and should not—be dominated by .nnhe thereum oundation works to identify gaps and imbalances across these layers. ’s role has never been to control or own all domains in thereum. nstead, our responsibility—nnour accountability—lies in upholding thereum’s valuesnn. hrough both our actions and our non-actions, we are accountable for ensuring that thereum remains resilient, not just as a network, but as a broader ecosystem of people, ideas, and values—never reduced to a single organization’s product.nnhe value ofnncredible neutralitynndoesn’t mean treating everything equally, it means making principled choices that protect thereum’s integrity at its core. ur philosophy of subtraction is often misunderstood t is not minimalism, nor does it mean doing less for the sake of it. t is a form of subtractive design thinking that focuses on outcomes rather than rigid methods. ubtraction is not the process, but the result we strive for a landscape with fewer imbalances, and less centralization that could compromise thereum’s values. nstead of assuming that less is always better, this mindset recognizes that achieving balance often requires thoughtful compleity or adding new mechanisms to ensure that no one entity,  included, dominates thereum’s evolution.nnuided by philosophynn has helped bootstrap new projects, new organizations and new heroes by owning only what we were best suited to own. ountless decisions, guided by this philosophy, have helped thereum become the largest ecosystem of its kind while keeping its potential infinite. thereum can do everything, be everywhere, and serve everyone, with each domain powered by the brightest minds, and above all, it must remain free from capture. hese values are our north star, and this is how we achieve the original vision of thereum as the world computer.nnhis philosophy flows through everything we do.nnome eamples of where our actions have impacted thereum & and infrastructurennnstead of controlling, we stewardnnll ore evnncalls to create space for technical decisions to emerge through community wisdom.nnennpromote client diversitynn, not just in number, but for clients to be successful and maintained by different teams across the ecosystem to avoid single points of failure.nnhe client incentive programnnhas also been supporting client teams in their work.nne support the coordination ofnn& interop retreatsnn, knowing that real breakthroughs happen when diverse teams cross-pollinate ideas.nnome efforts begin as seeds that we plant—likennccount bstractionnnornncross- coordinationnn, but they are designed to grow beyond our initial tending and now flourish through community cultivation.nnhe erge, and the shift to proof of stake, was nothing short of a mission-impossible. ot only because it had to be eecuted seamlessly while thousands of applications continued running, but because it required a delicate balance leadership without control, coordination without centralization.nnevconnnhas grown into something truly unique within the thereum ecosystem. t is not a normal conference, and it provides a space where community hubs and domain-specific events are led by those driving progress in their own corners of the ecosystem. e focus on nurturing leadership within diverse communities, empowering them to shape their own visions and connect with their people. lthough this approach makes coordination more comple, demands more time and resources, and requires us to embrace a level of unpredictability, we believe this is the best way to reflect what thereum truly is—a network of independent yet interconnected communities, each contributing to the whole.nnevconnectnn, which we’ve hosted since , is a natural etension of this philosophy creating spaces for deep, focused collaboration while allowing different communities to lead in their own way.nnn eecuting our efforts with this philosophy,  have encouraged our team to keep a key principle in mind  must keep evolving, just as thereum itself is a living, dynamic entity. owever, we must avoid evolving like a traditional corporation, because our goal isn't for  to "win" – it is for thereum to win over the long-term while staying true to its core values. s the ecosystem's needs evolve, our focus shifts from simply asking,nn"ow can  eecute this"nntonn"ow can thereum accomplish this, and what role should  play"nnhis doesn’t mean stepping back rather, we step forward with purpose, strategy, and intention, always guided by our mission to preserve the integrity and values of thereum.nnubtraction, not minimalismnnong-term sustainability, not short-term gainnnhoughtful compleity, not oversimplificationnntewardship, not controlnndaptive growth, not rigid structurennurposeful evolution, not corporate-like epansionnnommunity leadership, not dominancennrreplaceably niquennt’s been amazing to witness this growth of the ecosystem. even years ago, when  joined , thereum had fewer voices. articipation—both in building and securing the network—was concentrated in fewer hands and regions. ack then, as an clectic reamer (a title  preferred over ecutive irector),  often asked myself hat makes thereum not just different, but irreplaceably unique he answer was always clear yet profoundnntrue resilience, rooted in thereum’s valuesnn. thereum doesn’t grow like a machine it grows like a garden, strengthened by its biodiversity, flourishing becausennthe game as a whole is infinitenn. his vision—the nfinite arden—was born from that realization. oday, thereum thrives as a collage of voices core developers and researchers refining the protocol,  teams enabling scalability, application builders bridging thereum to the real world, and local communities shaping its future in their own ways. his richness—nnwhere technical and social innovation intertwine and influence each othernn—isn’t just a feature of thereum it’s the reason it endures.nnhen we hearnn"decentralization is the only way to build in my country"nnfrom someone in a place where democracy is broken, it reminds us how thereum's technical choices carry profound human implications. hile this infinite game cannot be played by  alone, we remain committed to upholding the values that allow thereum's technical and social innovation to continue to serve humanity.nnhank younnhen  first discussed the possibility of transitioning to resident with italik a year ago, it was with the intention of continuing to nurture the unique culture of thereum, and serving as a voice to bridge the gap between thereum and the broader global community. s in the ace ayering, culture moves the slowest, yet it provides a strong foundation for everything that follows (nn“f the slow parts are not occasionally frustrating, they are not doing their job - ”nn). ulture endures far beyond market cycles, sustains us through winter, and propels us through spring.nnhank you to every single person who was part of my journey during my last seven years, and to those who encouraged me to stay true to myself. rowing  and supporting thereum often required unconventional approaches, and decisions that challenged traditional organizational wisdom. 'm deeply grateful to those who inspired me to stay bold, and to trust that pursuing our values would light the path forward. t has never been an easy ride, and  could not have made it without you. nd my deep appreciation to everyone at the thereum oundation, past and present, who patiently and courageously participated in this etraordinary and unconventional journey together.nnhank you to all of you who keep reminding me why we are here in the first place.nnet’s continue building in the garden.nn--nnya iyaguchi
