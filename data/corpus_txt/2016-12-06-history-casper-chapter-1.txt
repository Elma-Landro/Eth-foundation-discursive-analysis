Titre: The History of Casper - Chapter 1\nAuteur: Vlad Zamfir\nDate: December 6, 2016\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/06/history-casper-chapter-1\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nitalik suggested last week that  share my basic research and design philosophy in a blog post,  agreed but complained that it was still changing. y friend on est told me that everyone would really appreciate it if  told everyone about my asper research,  mostly agreed. hen someone on reddit told me to focus on thereum.nno here's the asper tech story, given as a chronological history of the evolution of the key technology, ideas and language that are involved in "asper research". any of our favorite blockchain personalities are part of the story. his is my attempt to recount everything in an accessible, sequential way so that you can see where we are now (and where we're going) with our research efforts (so don't argue until the end of the story!). 'm going to try to release a chapter per day until it's complete.nnlso note that this is my personal point of view, understanding what little  could manage through the process of working on proof-of-stake. italik and reg eredith's accounts will vary, for eample, as they each have their own view of asper research.nnreface ow  started doing research at thereumnnarch -pril nn immediately got hooked on the lockchain technology story when itcoin first (really) caught my attention in arch of . his was during the "yprus crisis" run-up in the price of itcoin.  learned about cryptographic hashes, digital signatures and public key cryptography.  also learned about itcoin mining, and the incentives that miners have to protect the network.  was interested in computer science and security for the first time in my life. t was great.nnet against a narrative of dystopian libertarian economics, it was underground developers (like mir aaki) versus central bankers in an epic global battle to save the world from the fractional reserve banking system. he blockchain revolution was better than fiction.nn consumed content on reddit, listened to ets alk itcoin and a lot of eter odd content.  lost money on -e (once because  took advice from the trollbo).  argued with my friends than uchman and ach amsay about technology. e learned about asteroin and the possibility of building systems of top of itcoin, taking advantage of its roof-of-ork network effect. hen  first heard about proof-of-stake (o) in the  alt-coin scene (thanks oin!),  thought it sounded like heretical voodoo magic. eplacing miners with coins seemed like an inherently strange thing to try to do.  ended up deciding that the long-range attack problem was fatal, and any solutions were going to involve developer checkpoints of one form or another (an opinion  learned from eter odd). eing a itcoiner in  was one of the most intellectually stimulating eperiences of my life.nnn anurary or eburary ,  read about thereum for the first time.  watched italik's youtube videos, and  met him in person at the oronto ecentral itcoin eetups. e obviously knew way more of the tech story than  did, so  became hooked in, this time on thereum. thereum was the promise of decentralization made accessible to me, someone without much background. t was general purpose smart contracts that could do anything, disrupt any centralized system. t could be and do so many things that it wasn't always clear to me what role ethereum would actually play in the blockchain ecosystem. he blockchain tech story (as  see it) took an eciting turn with thereum, and  got to be closer to the action )nnaving been invited by ussel erbeeten at one of these meetups, than and  went to the hackathon prior to the  itcoin po in oronto. (italik taught me how to use erkle trees at this event.)  was thinking about properly incentivizing and decentralizing the peer review system for a couple of weeks, having recently had a paper rejected from an academic journal. than and  tried putting this kind of system together at the hackathon. than did most of the hard work using pyethereum, while  very slowly put together the first   ever made. e came in second place at the hackathon (after mir's "ark arket", which became pen azaar). e got to meet the whole thereum team at the po, and we got ourselves invited to the public kype channels! harles oskinson offered us jobs t was then, in pril , that we started volunteering for thereum. e even got ethereum.org email addresses.nno  got into the blockchain space because  got hooked on the itcoin tech story, and then on the thereum tech story.  then got hooked on the proof-of-stake tech story, which  now know to be very compelling. 'm going to share it, being as faithful as possible to the timeline and manner in which the parts of picture have been coming together, in an effort to help bring everyone up to speed on our efforts. t may take a few chapters, but story time ain't over 'til it's over.nnhapter  lasher + ecurity eposits he move from naive proof-of-stake to modern proof-of-stake.nnay  - eptember , nnhen italik first epressed interest in o to me in ay , first over kype and then at a itcoin conference in ienna,  was skeptical. hen he told me aboutnnslashernn, which  think he had come up in anuary . lasher was the idea that you could lose your block reward if you sign blocks at the same height on two forks.nnhis gave italik the ability to directly tackle (and arguably solve) the nothing-at-stake problem. (or the uninitiated, the "nothing-at-stake" problem refers to the fact that the o miners best strategy is to mine on all forks, because signatures are very cheap to produce). t also opened up our imaginations to a new space of interactive protocols for disincentivizing bad behaviour.nntill,  did not feel very satisfied with proof-of-stake at this time (despite italik telling me a couple of times that he thinks "proof-of-stake is the future") because  was really in love with proof-of-work. o during the summer  mostly worked on proof-of-work problems (-hard o, security sharing between o hains via "roofs-of-roof-of-ork", neither to completion). ut  did suggest the use of security deposits to a couple of contract developers on a couple of different occasions. his planted the seed for insights made on the fateful post-thereum-meetup night of eptember th  (kudos to tephan ual for organizing + getting me to that event!).nnthan uchman and  stayed up late talking about proof-of-stake at the "hacker" instead of the "party" section of mir aaki's squat in ondon.  connected the dots and internalized the power of security deposits for proof-of-stake. his was the night that  became convinced that o would work, and that making it work would be a huge amount of fun. t was also the first time  eperienced the surprising size of the o design space, through long arguments about attacks and possible protocol responses.nnince the early morning of eptember th,   have firmly advocated (to everyone who would listen) that blockchains move to o because it would be more secure. mir aaki was unimpressed by my enthusiasm for proof-of-stake. t least than and  were having the best time.nnhe use of security deposits always significantly leveraged slasher's effectiveness. nstead of forgoing some profit , a provably faulty node would lose a security deposit (imagined to be on the order of size /r) on which the block reward  was to be paid as interest (at rate r).nnou place a deposit to play, and if you play nice you make a small return on your deposit, but if you play mean you lose your deposit. t feels economically ideal, and it's so programmable.nndding deposits to slasher meant that the nothing at stake problem was officially solved.nnt least,  had made up my mind that it was solved to the point where we could no longer understand why anyone would want to build a proof-of-stake system without security deposits, for fear of nothing-at-stake problems.nnlso on eptember th,   met ink enguin for the first time, due to an introduction from tephan ual.  breathlessly recounted my o insights made the night before. nd after  respectfully declined a job from from ris ndustries (now ona) that week, ink enguin began sponsoring this research! (hanks !!)nnt this point in the story  was unaware of the other, multiple independent discoveries of the use of security deposits in proof-of-stake systems made by ae won, ominic illiams, and ick illiamson.nntay tuned... the net chapter is about the central role that ideas from game theory played in setting the design goals that led to asper!nn he views epressed here are solely my own personal views and do not represent those of the thereum oundation.  am solely responsible for what 've written and am not am not acting as a spokesperson for the oundation.
