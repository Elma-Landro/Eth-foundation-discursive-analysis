Titre: eth2 quick update\nAuteur: Danny Ryan\nDate: October 23, 2019\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/10/23/eth2-quick-update\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nlthough the internet has been more quiet than usual, we've been super busy hacking away on eth! etween evcon and keeping our heads down to work, it seems we've left the community in the dark on a couple of items. ere's a quick update to fill in the gaps.nneposit ontractnnlthough the deposit contract has beennnwrittennn,nntestednn, andnnformally verifiednn, we are working to allow the  standardization to stablize prior to launch. ne goal of eth is to be easily interoperable with other blockchains and systems in general, and to that end, we do not want our  signatures to go the way of keccak (whoops!).nnhe  tandard (nn ignaturenn,nnash to urvenn) has reached a point of stability recently with a number of blockchain teams on board (th, hia, ilecoin, lgorand, etc). here is an  meeting in ovember at which we epect the draft to be even more cemented. hat said, official standards can take quite a while so those involved plan to signal public support for the draft and have a "blockchain agreement" to use the standard as drafted regardless of its final form in . hat way, if it becomes the keccak of signatures, we won't be there alone. )nnortunately, the deposit contract does not need to be put into production until we near hase  launch, so this focus on standardization is not epected to have any effect on the hase  launch date.nnth estnetsnnf you follow ethresearch, the specs repo, or any of the many workshops at evcon, we havennaltered the sharding proposalnnin such a way to greatly improve developer and user eperience -- cross-shard communication between all shards at every slot. o facilitate this improved design, we have to modify the hase  spec a bit. o do this with limited disruption to hase  development and testnets, we've gone the simplifying route -- the removal of crosslinks entirely from hase  (they were stubbed anyway). his change is coded and under final reviewnnherennand is epected to be released for development within the week.nne epect multi-client public testnets to launch soon after this simplifying change is completed, for this update to aid hase ’s progress to mainnet, and ultimately to make hases  and  easier to ship.nnth testnets are coming! ndividual clients are in the process of spinning on some nets for both private and public consumption. any clients are just getting theirnneth-to-ethnnmachinery in place so these single-client testnets are useful in initially testing that component. n these nets there will be some limited cross-client testing, but will be largely stable due to having a majority single-client.nnnce clients adequately test larger single-client nets and once they have time to incorporate the hase  changes, we will be full speed ahead on public multi-client nets. e're just as ecited about this as you are and will be publishing more info on participation (nnstaking your ethnn) in both testnets and mainnet shortly. asper is indeed coming.
