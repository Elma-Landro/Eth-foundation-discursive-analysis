Titre: Ethereum for the Next Billion: Announcing the EF Fellowship Program\nAuteur: Aya Miyaguchi\nDate: May 7, 2021\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/07/ethereum-for-the-next-billion\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe progress being made in the thereum ecosystem lately is really inspiring. hether you’re ecited by the adoption of proof of stake (and a faster, more secure, greener thereum), the coming erge and other big upgrades, or by some of the many applications and solutions that have the power to change diverse industries, it is a great time to be a part of the thereum community.nnur evolving rolennhile we are all ecited about the growth of thereum and the future that our collective work can help to create,  am also often asked about the role of the thereum oundation and how our philosophy of subtraction fits into that future.nn“ociety grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.”nn- anonymous reek proverbnnhen we think about creating a real and lasting impact, one that outlives all of us personally as well as our organizations, it becomes important for us to subtract where we can so that the ecosystem - the thereum garden - can sustainably eist and thrive without relying too much on  or any other entity.nnowever, we also understand that there are many things that will not happen organically until the garden matures. omeone needs to plant seeds, others need to water them. nd we take care of the weeds when things block healthy growth in the garden. e care not only about longevity, but also about the health of the thereum garden so that thereum stays “thereum”.nneeking opportunities within the bigger picturennn pursuing the longevity and health of the ecosystem,  always encourage our team to zoom out and look at the bigger picture, as we consider which of the outstanding tasks only  can do. ne of the questions  often ask is “re we looking at the users who would most benefit from thereum”nneveloping countries today account for over % of the world’s population, and of about , of babies born every day around the world, more than , are born in developing countries. eople in developing nations represent not only our future as a people, but they may also represent the net billion active users of thereum. hat means new generations of developers that together make thereum’s tomorrow more resilient and stronger. n addition, thereum’s capability to enable trust, transparency, efficiency, and coordination has high potential in developing countries where these characteristics are often in short supply. t is in this contet - an overlap between opportunities, impact, and potential for thereum - that thennthereum oundation ellowship rogramnnwas created.nneet the  ellowship rogramnnhennthereum oundation ellowship rogramnnis a pilot project that has been launched bynnet illionnn, a team at  that focuses on seeking opportunities in emerging economies. he  ellowship rogram provides us an opportunity to work with change-makers, whose projects have high potential to create impact in emerging economies by using thereum. he program features a unique eperience that includes mentorship, epertise and access to leaders in the thereum ecosystem.nnow is this different from regular grant support ur vision is not only to support these specific projects, but to create a ripple effect. e hope others will learn from the work of this cohort, and be inspired to do similar work in their own communities, or even to create upgraded solutions.nnur inaugural cohortnnenson juguna (nncre fricann) is working to implement blockchain solutions to a microinsurance product that protects thousands of small-scale farmers in enya from etreme weather events. is project will test and showcase thereum’s potential to enable the viability and sustainability of products and services that target the bottom of the wealth pyramid.nnhuy epeda (nn.itynn) provides municipal and national governments a platform to easily issue digital identities and blockchain-based documents to their citizens, with a vision to one day hold government-issued documents (like permits and s) in our thereum wallets. uring the ellowship rogram, he and his team will work with the government of rgentina and create strategies to advance the meaningful adoption of blockchain in the public sector in atin merica.nnuldeep andhu ryal (nnnn) will develop a blockchain and crypto strategy for , the world’s largest . ased in angladesh,  serves over  million people annually. uldeep's project involves multiple eperiments using blockchain, and it could serve as a model for other social enterprises, and for the development sector at large.nnaroa urutuza (nnigann) is eploring thereum-based solutions as part of iga’s effort to connect every school to the internet. y helping to provide today’s most important public good to billions of currently unconnected people, aroa is envisioning many roles that blockchain can play, from increasing the accountability of service providers and financing connectivity infrastructures, to an access point to the global economy and marketplaces.nntay informed and involvednnhile starting small and as an eperiment with this pilot class, this program is also a new strategic avenue for  to allocate resources to regions that are still blue ocean for the future of thereum. he issues being focused upon have large and long-term implications on thereum’s value as something that can achieve public sector adoption while helping to bring about financial inclusion, positively impacting the fight against climate change and more.nne are ecited to start working with enson, huy, uldeep and aroa for the pilot year of the thereum oundation ellowship rogram as they bring thereum to their projects over the coming months.nnongrats to aira shikura and erena an from the et illion team on the launch, and we would also like to say special thank you to those who helped us identify candidates.nne’re looking forward to working with other community members in supporting these ellows, and if you would like to stay connected with the ellowship rogram or any of the ellows, pleasennsign up to stay informed herenn, or contact the team atnnfellowshipethereum.orgnn.
