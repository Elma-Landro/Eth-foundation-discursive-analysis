Titre: Vitalik’s Research and Ecosystem Update\nAuteur: Vitalik Buterin\nDate: October 18, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/10/18/vitaliks-research-and-ecosystem-update\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nver the last five days, myself, our eecutive director ing han, and several others from the thereum team and thereum-based projects and businesses includingnnakernn,nntring/finitynnandnnonsensysnnhave been visiting hina and ong ong, where there have been a series of back-to-back conferences and events most notably including thennlockchain orkshopnnin ong ong on ct - and the "nnirst lobal lockchain ummitnn" in hanghai organized by our friends atnnaniangnnon ct -, while at the same time continuing to work on our usual tasks of research, development, planning con and administrative matters.nnoth conferences proved to be, at least in my own admittedly optimistic estimation, highly positive signs of the growth in the thereum ecosystem. t the ong ong event, on the first day we participated in semi-closed sessions on issues such as decentralized governance, identity and reputation and regulatory compliance. obin anson brought up the topic of prediction markets as a form of "low-cost micro-governance" if there are situations where a legal or arbitration process is required in order to ultimately resolve disputes, use a prediction market to provide the result instead, only occasionally escalating to the underlying arbitration mechanism. nyone with private information has the incentive to participate in the prediction market the parties to the dispute themselves, any third parties involved, and even firms like oogle applying top-of-the-line machine learning algorithms in most cases, a result that accurately predicts the result that would be obtained by the underlying court or arbitration system should be attainable very cheaply.nnhe net two days consisted of panel discussions on technical and philosophical topics, people discussing their own projects, and the future of blockchains in areas like reputation and internet of things. thereum was mentioned many times - not through us marketing ourselves, but by many individuals who see thereum as a worthwhile technology on which to build their applications.nnhe hanghai conference was equally impressive. his was also a two-day event, with the first day featuring back-to-back public speeches and panels and the second day focusing on topic-focused sessions  personally was involved in moderating the technical discussions on consensus and scalability. his was a fairly large event, perhaps the largest since the lobal itcoin ummit in eijing which was my first eperience with hina over one year before and, as has happened over the same period in the est, the audience has transformed to be more mainstream rather than just employees of itcoin-specific (or even crypto-specific) projects attending, we saw representatives from major banks, government officials, ntel, uawei and others from traditional industry there.nneople seem ecited to see how they could adopt blockchain technology for their own use - and there was plenty of interest to go around regarding thereum specifically. t is indeed true that there are legal restrictions, some fairly clear and some gray, limiting the potential for adoption of itcoin or cryptocurrencies in hina, but there are as yet no issues whatsoever with blockchain technology. he days before and after the conference, we took the time to meet aniang as well as the other groups in hina that we have regular contact with, particularly both myself and ing meeting for the first time the wonderful team atnnhttp//ethfans.org/nn. e are still determining how we can work with hinese individuals and business and make thereum as useful as possible in what has become by purchasing power paritynnthe largest economy in the worldnn, but it is clear that the possibilities and the potential are great.nnesearch and rotocol evelopmentnne have identified four key areas of research regarding the underlying protocol that we feel represent the key milestones standing in the way between thereum as it currently eists and crypto-utopiannzk- integrationnn integrating, whether through a new opcode or ideally by leveraging the 's eisting -bit modular arithmetic, the ability for thereum contracts to verify succinct zero-knowledge proofs. iven that the verification keys can be generated entirely off-chain, this is somewhat easier than it looks, though once implemented quite a bit of infrastructural work will be needed to make it etremely useful. n initial goal will be to use it to implement ultra-private coin miing as well as a privacy-preserving reputation ("here's a proof showing that  have a score of over  according to your reputation scoring metric and using this set of data published to the blockchain, so you should trust me, but  won't revealnnwhichnnof the parties that you should trust  am") and two-party financial contracts, and the longer-term goal will be an implementation ofnnawknnon thereum at and outside the above-mentioned conferences, we have had some productive chats with some of the developers of these technologies on how to move forward on accomplishing this.nnaspernn thereum's proof of stake algorithm now under development by lad amfir with help from ucius reg eredith, myself and several others. he key components include by-block instead of by-chain consensus and the concept of "economic consensus by bet" as a way of approaching de-facto finality with eponential speed rather than linear speed as is the case with proof of work. he goal is to combine a block time reduction (my personal opinion is that  seconds will likely prove to be an good balance between safety and resource overconsumption and centralization risk lad is as usual more aggressive), finality and much lower energy consumption (and - lowernnprice-of-anarchynngenerally). urrently, lad and reg are working on formally describing and implementing the non-economic part of the algorithm to mathematically prove convergence properties, and the second step will be optimizing the economics.nncalabilitynn using a combination of sharding schemes, random sampling, heavy use of erkle proofs and asynchronous calling in order to increase the potential transaction throughput from ~- transactions per second to over  (or, if super-quadratic versions are used, a theoretically unlimited number). he basic concepts behind scaling have been set in stone for over si months, and our research team is highly confident that the general approach is valid what remains is the details of eactly how to make optimal tradeoffs that preserve as much of thereum .'s functionality as possible in a scalable contet.  key design goal is to make sure the thereum . remains a superset of thereum . for eample, synchronous calls should still be possible within a single shard, though cross-shard calls may require asynchrony.  plan on updatingnnmy scalability papernnto make it more focused, readable and updated with the latest ideas over the net month or so, though in general scalability research is on the back-burner until asper is solidified.nn upgradesnn artin ecze has taken the lead on eploringnnebssemblynnas a candidate for an upgraded thereum virtual machine. ebssembly shares many properties with the  the need to run untrusted code, the need for code to be very small, and the need to have multiple compatible implementations, though it lacks gas counting. ebssembly can be used to create a just-in-time compiler for the , drastically speeding up the ethereum js implementation, and it can also potentially be used as a virtual machine option itself by adding a transformation step that adds a gas subtracting instruction to code before every jump operation. nvironment opcodes likennnn,nnnn, etc can be abstracted away by turning them into an  over a generic foreign function interface (eg.nn(k, v)nnbecomesnn( ++ k ++ v)nnwherennnn would be the marker representingnnnn).nnside from this, research questions remain on middleware "on top of" thereum, including on-chain services, decentralized governance, identity and reputation, random number generation, formal verification for olidity (we have found a talented team in ondon that is ecited about starting to eplore the subject) and prediction market implementations, as well as on projects that may live "alongside" thereum (eg. hisper), though the foundation is leaving it to the community to do much of this etra work as we have deliberately undertaken a strategy of focusing on the core (and doing so in a very lightweight fashion).nnegarding omestead, the omestead milestone has always been somewhat arbitrary in its definition unlike rontier, which is marked by a grand and ceremonious launch of the blockchain, and etropolis, which is marked by the release of ist, omestead was always simply meant to be the point where we go from saying "thereum is unsafe" to "thereum is somewhat safe". ver the last two months, we have released a wallet, alphas for state tree pruning in pyethereum and cpp-ethereum and headers-first syncing in o, upgrades to olidity, very early work in the "light ethereum sub-protocol" () and are soon releasing the . versions of cpp-ethereum and i.nnur internal target has been to launch omestead when the rontier network has successfully run without serious problems for  weeks (the "serious problem" threshold being downgraded from the rontier definition of "consensus failure" to a more epanded definition which is something like "consensus failure  people losing large amounts of money  semi-serious network glitches") we plan on announcing a more detailed strategy for omestead soon but suffice it to say that we are already mostly there.nncon is still slated for ovember - in ondon, and we are looking forward to seeing everyone there!
