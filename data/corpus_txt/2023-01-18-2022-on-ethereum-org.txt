accessible to everyone!nnoin the translation programnnommunity engagement 🤝nnthereum.org is the work of thousands of incredible contributors, and every contribution helps us build a great resource for the community. s with the translation program, ethereum.org saw ecellent engagement in many other community-driven initiatives. n  we hit , iscord members, an incredible , rowdin members, and the huge milestone ofnn, total contributors on itubnn!nnpecifically, between ournnrollout of ypescriptnnandnnthe  library migrationnn, we had over  code contributors 🤯!nnor content, we also had tens of

ethereum.org design system. t took a lot of work to get the design to where it is, and we’re ecited to share it. n  , we’ll begin implementing the code to support the new design system.nnne of the overarching goals behind creating a design system is to give designers a way to contribute to the open-source thereum community. n , we’ll continue to work with the community to open up our design processes to the community.nnant to get involvednnollow along in igmannand join the conversation in ournn#design iscord channelnn.nnots of new pages 🥳nn was the biggest year yet for new content on ethereum.org. e addressed many of our content gaps and delivered informative, well-received pages that were read by more than a million people.nnhere are too many pages to list everything here (now more than  pages on the website!), but some of the highlights includennayer nn teaches users why thereum is scaling through rollups and how to onboard to layer .nnun a nodenn highlights the value of running a node (both to people running their own node and to thereum generally) and gives readers step-by-step resources to start running their own nodes.nntaking hubnn demystifies the staking process and the key benefits of different staking approaches.nnntroduction to ebnn eplains the principles of eb, its philosophy, and current limitations.nnnergy consumptionnn shows thereum’s current and historical energy consumption and the impact he erge had.nnn , we’ll continue working with our community and subject-matter eperts within the thereum ecosystem to fill our gaps and deliver high-value content to our readers. f you’d like to help,nnreach out to us on iscordnn.nnou can see what we’re working on net innnour quarterly roadmapnn, or you cannncreate an issuennif there is content you’d like to see added to ethereum.org.nnind wallet revamp 👛nnnother huge milestone in  was the revamp of our wallets content.  large portion of traffic to ethereum.org is from users looking to get their first wallet. n our previous find a wallet page, it took a lot of work to compare the different features wallets offered, making it hard for users to decide which wallet best suited their needs.nnfter several design iterations, we landed on creating an e-commerce-like eperience—allowing users to filter wallets by specific features, compare features between wallets, and select user personas with recommended features.nnheck out our find a wallet pagenn. e love feedback let us know your thoughtsnnon our iscordnn.nnearn hub and learn quizzes 🧠nnhere is a constant stream of new users trying to learn about thereum. n , we spent a lot of time focussing on creating a better eperience for these users. reating easy-to-understand content is a driving principle of everything we work on, but these two initiatives were especially focused on this subset of our users.nnearn hubnne creatednnthe earn ubnnbecause users needed help finding a starting point for learning about thereum without feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information available and the disconnectedness of the different pages on our website. he earn ub is a guided pathway for users, starting from the basics of what cryptocurrencies are, walking them through getting started on thereum with their first wallet, teaching them how the thereum protocol works, and how they can get involved in the ecosystem.nnearning quizzesnns well as providing a structured learning path with the earn ub, we wanted to make learning about thereum more fun for users, improve their retention, and gamify the process. o do this, we created learning quizzes. ach quiz has several questions, with multiple potential answers with eplanations after submitting an answer to help teach users when they get questions wrong.nne currently have learning quizzes on eight pages and plan to epand it with more functionality and pages in . hey’re a ton of fun! heck them outnnhat is thereum quiznnhat is ther quiznnntroduction to eb quiznnayer
