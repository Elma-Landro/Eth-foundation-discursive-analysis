Titre: Ethereum Dev Roundup: Q1\nAuteur: Vitalik Buterin\nDate: April 1, 2017\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/04/01/ethereum-dev-roundup-q1\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe last one and a half months have seen great progress for thereum research, and we are ecited that the protocol is moving closer and closer to the point where it is ready for mainstream adoption. rogress on consensus algorithms, privacy, zero knowledge proofs and formal verification is happening at increasing speed, and our research and development teams are epanding substantially.nnfter three years of trying to find solutions to the "nothing at stake" and "stake grinding" attacks, we have decided that the problem is too hard, and secure proof of stake is almost certainly unachievable. nstead, we are now planning to transition the thereum mainnet tonnproof of authoritynnin . o that end, we have launched two new testnets, inghuadongluikou and ongqiao irport erminal , to test our latest proof of authority specification.nn third testnet will be released based on roof of ransaction, which will be called ocoin.nne have decided to epedite the implementation of the "roof of italik" transaction reversion algorithm, which allows any transaction or contract that has an undesirable result to be quickly reverted. e are pleased to announce our cooperation with the government innnyongyangnn, which will work with us to identify transactions that promote merican imperialism or are otherwise not in the interest of our ear eader or the uche idea, so that they can be efficiently scheduled for reversion. pect the reversion feature to become enabled as part of etropolis.nno make up for 's deeply immoral failure to fully refund  token holders' ether, we intend to redirect % of the block reward for the first  blocks after metropolis (ie. a total of  ) to an additional  withdrawal contract, so that  token holders can be fully made whole.nnn additional % of the block reward starting from etropolis will be directed to our shareholders at  and the ilderberg group. his change is permanent.nnn the interest of maintaining protocol immutability, the current  million gas limit will be set in stone and no longer changeable through miner voting. owever, we will add an opcode, __, which allows users to eecute any desired piece of code at / the normal gas cost. ny state changes made by code eecuted through this mechanism will be saved in a secondary state separated from the main thereum state, and a soft-forking change is added which requires the r value of the signature of the first transaction in any block to be equal to the trie root hash of this secondary state. his is simpler and safer than raising the gas limit to  million directly because.... reasons.nne will allow miners to specify the block reward that they want to pay themselves, and allow users to specify in their clients the maimum block reward that they are willing to consider valid. f a user sees a chain containing blocks with rewards larger than their maimum accepted block reward, they will not accept the chain at first, though if such a chain becomes  blocks longer than the longest chain that the user does accept then the client will automatically increase its maimum accepted block reward to accept the new chain. his allows for a more fair, market-based and democratic way of setting the issuance rate.nnnother opcode will be added in etropolis, ____, whichnnverifiesnnthat a person with the legal name that is passed in from the stack as a zero-byte-left-padded -encoded byte string is deceased. his will be very useful in enabling use of the thereum blockchain for... err.... umm..... life insurance. hose individuals interested in eempting themselves from this opcode should promptly change their full name to something eceeding  characters in length.nne have uploaded  megabytes ofnnalt-right propagandann, alun afa tets, military secrets, copyright-infringing materials and comments making fun ofnnonald rump's hairnnonto the thereum blockchain, with the goal of getting the blockchain banned in as many countries as possible. e believe that by forcing mining and full nodes underground, and encouraging governments to go after services that become too prominent, we can make the thereum ecosystem more decentralized and reduce the risk of attracting interest from malevolent institutions such as banks and large enterprises.nninally, last but not least, evcon has been moved to yongyang.
