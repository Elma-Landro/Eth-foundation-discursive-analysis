Titre: Beyond Borders - Unveiling Potential of Blockchain in a Crisis\nAuteur: Karam Alhamad\nDate: November 15, 2023\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/11/15/beyond-borders-nb\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nrisis is a cruel teacher. t can draw us together in our shared fragility, but paradoically it can also distance us from our shared humanity. n times of great crisis, the institutions and structures of society that are supposed to protect and support us may become twisted, corrupted, or rendered impotent – and sometimes, the very things that make us humans can play a role in our collective dehumanization.nnn yria, my political activism became the grounds for denying me the most basic forms of identification.  was detained and tortured as a means of political repression. y academic pursuits forcibly halted, and any semblance of proof of my eistence was stripped away.  nd , along with millions of others like me, had to escape that reality smuggling myself across borders to seek refuge in another country – where  had to start from scratch filing with offices for new identity documents, applying for access to a bank account, a place of residence, and all the other bits of paperwork one needs to possess in order to be recognized as a human being in modern society.nnhe risis as atalyst for nprecedented hangennor over a decade working in the international aid and development sector, ’ve grappled with some troubling questions re our traditional systems really equipped to respond to large-scale humanitarian crises re the powerful and wealthy institutions committed to protecting the world’s most vulnerable humans really doing all they can an we do better ownnhrough my ellowship at the thereum oundation, ’ve conducted research and seen firsthand that public blockchain protocols like thereum are more than a neat innovation – or people caught in humanitarian crises - from yria to yanmar, ebanon, and beyond - where conflicts and crises erode trust in fundamental technologies and where authoritarian regimes and centralized power structures have shaken collective trust in institutions, emerging technologies can be a lifeline in times of unimaginable human suffering, and they represent a glimpse into a future model of crisis response unencumbered by borders and institutional inertia.nnhen ach etour osts ives and rustnnicture the colossal amount of wealth that is $. billion  dollars. hat is the total amount of international humanitarian aid allocated in . f that staggering sum,nnonly .% is sent to local s in the form of direct aidnn. he rest moves through a chain of subcontractors, global funds, and multilateral institutions that spend large sums on operational costs. illions of dollars that are supposed to secure food or medical supplies for those in need end up earmarked for items like pristine white oyota and ruisers, business-class trips to eneva, or costly office spaces in the nearest stable city center. illions more are lost to corruption, waste, and mismanagement. his imbalance eposes a harsh reality resources meant to serve as a lifeline for those in pain are often whittled away by the same structures created to help them.nnraph  eneral framework of foreign aidnns someone who spent years managing millions of donor funding into yria,  see this development framework as not just a flawed system - it's a betrayal of trust and a squandering of resources on a gigantic scale. t's a system that turns every dollar into a trickle by the time it reaches those in desperate need.nnhe realities of international aid are well-known, including and especially to the organizations working directly with people in crisis. nfortunately, those organizations don’t often see any alternative. y research for the et illion ellowship aimed to uncover the attitudes and beliefs of s and s working in yria and raq towards blockchain technology – to see if the imagined technology might open up new pathways of support. hese are organizations that work in etreme contets surrounded by death, neglect, and hostile dictatorship. hey work within distributed networks of grassroots volunteers, organizing to do their work amidst air-strikes, sanctions, and all kinds of eistential risks. ne would think there is a natural fit for humanitarian organizations to embrace technologies of decentralization.nny research revealed a more complicated picture. arly in , only % of the  s and s  spoke with saw blockchain as a promising alternative to traditional aid support. mong those that responded positively, only  organizations were actively utilizing it in their operations and work. heir skepticism was deep.  remember one revealing conversation with the head of a renowned  who feared that the creation of a metamask wallet might open them up to de-platforming on their eisting donation pipelines of ayal or ounde. e feared that eperimenting with crypto for donations would raise a red flag with the large-scale institutions their  must remain in good standing with.  saw his fear as much more than healthy caution it’s a form of unintentional paralysis that prevents meaningful, transformative change to the status quo. n a world where every second and every cent counts, hesitancy comes at a cost.nnrisis he nforgiving lassroomnnhe . magnitude earthquake on ebruary , , taught us a brutal lesson in disparity between yria and ürkiye disaster response. n yria, over . million people, already scarred by displacement and conflict, were faced with a new catastrophe. s buildings crumbled, claiming over , lives, the need for aid was dire and immediate.nnurkish s responded swiftly, leveraging eisting avenues of blockchain-based donation pipelines to raise over  million  within just  hours. heir innovative use of cryptocurrency,  sales, and platforms like ndaoment and he iving lock not only showed their digital literacy, but also highlighted the vast gap in resources and technology between the two nations. urkish government initiatives and campaigns like “urkey - nited eart'' further demonstrated their efficient mobilization, raising a staggeringnn. billion urkish irasnn(equivalent to $. billion ) in one night.nny contrast, yrian organizations, constrained by a fractured compliance and legal infrastructure and limited access to global fundraising platforms, struggled. he olham eam, a key yrian , managed to collect a mere $. million over a week. hile this disparity was not solely a matter of technology, it was compounded by international sanctions that impeded access to resources and humanitarian aid, deepening the crisis for the vulnerable. owever, as highlighted innndiscussions by epertsnn, the primary hindrance to effective aid delivery in yria was not solely these sanctions but also the actions of the yrian regime. ractices such as siphoning off aid for black market sales and mismanaging resources further eacerbated the challenges faced by humanitarian efforts, adding layers of compleity to an already dire situation.nnut in the aftermath of the quake, a palpable transformation was beginning in opposition areas. anners prominently displayed by hawala offices advertised their acceptance of crypto transfers, signaling a significant shift towards digital currency. s in these areas started approaching digital currency with more urgency and practical curiosity. ome began receiving individual donations to their own wallets, while seeking more clarity and assurance from international donors. patriate yrian organizations like the aram oundation, operating under clearer regulatory frameworks in other countries, were able to utilize platforms like “he iving lock” for secure donations.nnraph  dvertisement by a yrian local transfer office mentioning they accept and facilitate crypto transactions - ource yrian  in leppo, orthern yriann believe this scenario marked the beginning of a transition from tentative eploration to cautious, proactive integration of blockchains for disaster relief.nnhe head of uratona for evelopment in eastern yria shared with me a perspective of cautious optimism, suggesting that the successful use of crypto donations in kraine for humanitarian aid response had reduced apprehensions about using it in yria. “e are telling the donors we are not just ready to use it we do need it,” he stated.nnrom kepticism to doption  urning idennn our pre-crisis survey, only  of  organizations had considered blockchains as a viable alternative to entrenched systems. ost-crisis,  of the same s responded positively, and many had already started incorporating the technology into their work and operations. ith the luury of choice and time stripped away, those on the ground didn't just adapt they transformed. hom had once been skeptical were now embracing digital currency as their go-to solution for remittances and donations.nnhe earthquake was a true turning point for yrian aid. yrian opposition organizations began taking cues from the progressive stance of urkish institutions, benefiting from legal clarity in urkey and decreased skepticism. mall organizations within yria began openly soliciting crypto donations on their social media accounts.nne're not just talking about a few early adopters here. ven large, mainstream s  spoke with underwent legal consultations to eplore blockchain-based funding channels. he maze of compliance and regulations presents its own hurdles, underscoring a clear need for education and system refinement, but the fear that had once paralyzed them was now largely absent.nne-humanizing mpactnnf this story tells us anything, it's that the theoretical debates around new channels of aid are over. e are now in the realm of the practical, the tangible, and the desperately urgent. eer-to-peer aid is not just about raising money it's about re-engineering trust in a world marred by crises. e can narrow the distance between giver and receiver, fostering a sense of proimity even from continents away. n this new paradigm, aid becomes a personal gesture rather than a faceless transaction, transforming the giver-receiver dynamic into one of solidarity.nnhen borders and bureaucracies become walls that obscure our shared humanity, public protocols stand as a vital artery, enabling not just the flow of funds but the pulse of human connection. t’s more than a tool it's a lifeline in a fractured world. s global crises lay bare the frailties of our traditional systems - systems that falter and fragment under duress - blockchains may be able to offer a more resilient alternative – one that treats all participants fairly, regardless of their socio-political contet.nnaram lhamad is a second-year  student at ackson chool for lobal ffairs at ale niversity with  years of eperience in international development, specializing in research and grants management, focusing on iddle astern dynamics. is current work eplores blockchain technology's potential in humanitarian aid. is research report will be published later this year.
