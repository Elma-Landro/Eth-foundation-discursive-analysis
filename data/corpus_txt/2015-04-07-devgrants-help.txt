Titre: DEVgrants: Here to Help\nAuteur: ÐΞVgrants Team\nDate: April 7, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/07/devgrants-help\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\new would argue against the fact that thereum has been gifted with one of the most diverse and thoughtful communities ever gathered around any open source project. ueled by what can only be described as impassioned determination, developers from all walks of life have risked their time and credibility to pioneer in this radical and largely unknown domain of innovation. ndeed, even before genesis, thereum already boasts hundreds of projects covering everything from self-stabilizing currency to potential replacements for government services. oday we are launching a new program to support and thank those who continue to take this journey with us.nnntroducing ÐΞgrants.nnÐΞgrants is a program that offers funding for contributions to both the thereum platform, and projects based on thereum. ts goals are threefoldnno provide developers interested in contributing to the thereum ecosystem the opportunity to spend significant time on their project, in order to bring it to completion.nno etend the codebase with useful components that are not the main focus of Ξ, but which would be very valuable to users of thereum generally.nno increase our outreach to other communities and the general public.nnÐΞgrants will focus eclusively on giving a boost to efforts already in progress. n other words, if you have not already begun work on your project, you should do so before attempting to apply.nnote that although Ξ does not bias against applications from businesses or developers who may wish to profit from the fruits of ÐΞgrant-funded projects, ÐΞgrants should  be considered a funding platform for new business endeavors. nly those applicants creating an open source public goodnnfor public benefitnn, will be considered.nnhat ÐΞgrants is otnnt isnnnna venture capital programme. e will not "invest" or "grant" funding for projects which do not have on-going development.nnt isnnnna bounty programme. e do not seek to describe specific goals in advance nor do we wish to attribute value to them.nnt isnnnna Ðpp seed funding programme. t this point in our development process, most Ðpps score near the bottom of critical value for our development process.nno be eligable, you mustnnbe already working on a projectnnreasonably be delivering value to critical components of the thereum core software, its development process or key parts of the ecosystem (common services, s, s).nnrant funding may be used to help deliver or maimise value of personal contributions, e.g.nnpayment of professional services or equipmentnnpayment of epenses incurred as part of collaborative workflownnpayment to help with subsistence costs of project members (generally when taking time from employment).nnhe application process.nnarties interested in receiving funding should get in touch with the ÐΞgrants administrator (nngrantsethereum.orgnn), submitting three items a proposal that outlines the intended work, a project plan that details timelines and estimated working hours, and a proposed methodology for reporting on the progress and outcomes of the project.nne additionally ask that you include one or more means of realtime contact – /elegram/kype ,  nick, phone number, etc – and your time zone.nnΞ will make a best effort to evaluate new proposals within  weeks of receipt. pproved applicants will be requested to sign a contract with Ξ, and to accelerate development as soon as possible. he contract is a legal contract between the successful applicant and Ξ, and we recommend that all applicants review the terms carefully, prior to submitting their application.nnow will evaluation worknnnitial evaluationnnhe initial evaluation will be conducted by the ÐΞgrants administrator, consisting of a review of the application, a high-level investigation into the state of the project, and an online interview with one or more of the project developers. his evaluation will concern itself with the social and technical merits of the project, including its broader applicability and benefit to the thereum ecosystem, the general character of its developers, and the progress made so far.nninal evaluationnninal evaluations will be conducted by the ÐΞgrants board, a team consisting of founding members of thereum, plus the ÐΞgrants administrator. his evaluation will review the summarized results of the initial evaluations of the previous two weeks. pplicants may or may not be invited to parts of this discussion for the purposes of further review and eamination.nnhat should a proposal

nnnn,nnnntnnonn, tonnnn,nnnntnnonn, per project, or just enough to cover a few months of living epenses for one or more developers.nnΞ can offer disbursement in two different ways, depending on the

completion.nnption twonnultiple payments, based on milestone achievements.nnhe desired method can and should be requested in the application, but Ξ ultimately reserves the right to choose.nnhat about transparencynnll projects approved by ÐΞgrants will be made public in both name and application, on the forthcoming ÐΞgrants eb site and on thenngrantsnnwitter account. n most cases, any project funded will already have a publicly-accessible repository, and in all cases must adhere to one or more specified open source licenses.nnn conclusionnngain, we thank you, the community, for all of your development efforts, critiques, and encouragement. t is our hope that this program will lend a small but helpful hand to your remarkable work, and we look forward to reading your applications in full.nnomments, questions and applications should be directed to the ÐΞgrants administrator atnngrantsethereum.orgnn. nterested parties may also follownngrantsnnon witter for updates about funded
