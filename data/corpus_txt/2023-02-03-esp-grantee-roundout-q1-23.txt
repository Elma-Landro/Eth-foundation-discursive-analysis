Titre: Grantee Roundup - Q1 2023\nAuteur: Ecosystem Support Program Team\nDate: February 3, 2023\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/02/03/esp-grantee-roundout-q1-23\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nt’s always fun to hear about new grants as they’re awarded, but what happens after the announcement n this series, we check in on projects that are well underway or already at the finish line.nnou may have noticed something different—instead of monthly posts, we'll be highlighting grantees who have made significant strides in their projects every quarter instead. ead on to learn about some recent milestones and achievements by grantees!nnark rystalnnbynnagma ollectivenn ey management shared among peersnneer-to-peer systems put power back into the hands of users by offering them complete control over their own data, but what if you don't want to run the risk of losing your private keys his is the precise problem that ark rystal seeks to address.nnark rystal is a set of protocols and guidelines which emphasizes trust between peers rather than individual responsibility throughnnsecret sharingnn. his involves using mathematical algorithms to create distributed (i.e. stored in multiple locations) backups of a piece of data, and users can select custodians to safekeep their backups.  particular threshold amount of locations, or 'shards', is required to recover the data. o information about the original secret is revealed even if a particular shard is compromised, and the secret can still be recovered even if some shards are lost.nno achieve this, the team has developednnlibraries for developersnnwho want to implement a social backup feature in their app, and annstand-alone dappnnthat allows users to secure their encrypted backups using the blockchain. ark rystal is % open-source, with libraries for annavascript implementationnn, annreference implementation in avann, and annust implementationnn.nnhennalpha release of the dappnnfor their thereum-specific client has been published on oerli as they continue to iron out the kinks, improve features, and eplore integrations with eisting thereum projects. ecently, they've focused their attention on three important areasnnransport and mesagingnnsing thennaku v protocolnn, they've been able to develop annmessaging systemnnwith three message types—one for public encryption keys, one for sending a shard, and one for requesting a shard.nnulti-wallet supportnnhe dapp is currently configured to connect smoothly tonnetaasknn, but they want to epand this by integratingnnalletonnectnnto support interaction with multiple wallets.nnesignnnfter etensive user research, the team decided to primarily design for internet-connected devices as opposed to air-gapped devices, but it will still be possible to make backups on the latter with theirnnoffline-first clientnn.nno learn more, head over to the ark rystalnnwebsitenn, delve

thereum's network. eedless to say, this wasn't an overnight success, and thtaker was one of the teams working tirelessly to support this monumental upgrade.nnthtaker is a community-driven initiative that's passionate about easing the compleity or confusion surrounding staking. ncouraging solo staking is one of their primary goals, and the team also helps anybody wanting to stake to find the most appropriate method for their specific situation in a way that best supports a healthy eaconchain. his is accomplished through offering a support network that provides user-friendly educational resources, discusses theory, and walks members through technical issues with a motto of "welcoming first, knowledgeable second".nnhey organized the first evernntaking athering at evconnectnnlast year (pr  - , ), with the twin goals of encouraging the development of new thereum staking tools and bringing together fellow community members. he multi-track event was open to new stakers, eperienced stakers, and open-source developers. alks and roundtables occupied the first two days, while the third day featured an open-source thereum staking hackathon with seven participating teams.nnn ay , they launched annnthereum taking uadratic unding oundnnin collaboration withnnclr.fundnnand thennthereum oundationnn. he goal of the round was to provide additional critical support for the thereum staking ecosystem's public goods infrastructure.nnuadratic fundingnnwas also specifically selected as the funding mechanism to encourage community-based support for staking and leveling the playing field. he round turned out to be a resounding success, with a total of ,  being distributed acrossnn different projectsnn.nnll year, the thtaker team has been steadfastly organizingnncommunity callsnnwith staking protocols and infrastructure projects, hostingnnvalidator workshopsnn, and empowering the staking community with knowledge and tools, such as an in-progress encyclopedicnnnowledge asenn. thtaker brings awareness and community engagement to the quiet development surrounding the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism (they organized the entire erge call seriesnnopstennn,nnoerlinn,nnepoliann, andnnainnetnn—, total views!), counterbalancing popular narratives that focus on short-lived, hype-driven projects to showcase the core technology and diligent research that sits at the center of the ecosystem.nnf you'd like to be a part of the community, you can join them onnniscordnn, tune in to their community calls and validator workshops onnnoutubenn, follow them onnnwitternnfor updates, engage in lively discussions onnnedditnn, and even check out their progress onnnagyunn—a one-click installer that automates the setup and management of all the infrastructure needed for staking on thereum—viannitubnn.nn-esistant  bynnádiusnn itigating the risks of nnhe issue ofnnmaimal etractable valuenn() has been gaining greater attention, especially amongnneinnprojects as it could cause unintended financial loss for users including high gas prices, increased slippage, and worse eecution on trades. owever, an even more crucial concern is blockchain re-organization and consensus instability, which might happen if the  available in a block significantly eceeds the standard block, thus potentially incentivizing validators to re-organize blocks and capture the  for themselves.nnhe ádius team aims to tackle these issues in ei protocols by building an -resistant automated market maker () that implements ractical erifiable elay unction () technology utilizing time-lock encryption andnnzero-knowledge () proofsnn. ime-lock encryption was selected as a core component because it can prevent transactions from being frontrun if the content is encrypted until it is reasonable to assume that ordering finality has been reached and fair ordering has been performed.nnheir plan is ambitious. ransactions on the  will be encrypted using time-lock puzzles, and  proofs will be implemented to ensure that each transaction statement is true and the transaction is encrypted correctly.nnlthough this is a mammoth task, the team has already made considerable headway in proving the feasibility of an -resistant . tarting with their proof of concept implementation on ptimism which was completed during their grant, the team has participated in thennackoney nnhackathon hosted by lobal, winning the op  inalist and niswap rants awards. ver the net couple of months, the team will be refining their  on layer  with added features, slated for release at the end of this year.nnltimately, they are aiming for a -based layer  that addresses the greater problems arising from centralization on scaling solutions, including . n the meantime, you can dive deeper into the technology through theirnnthereum esearch forum postnn, follow them onnnwitternnfor updates, check out theirnnwebsitenn, or join their community onnniscordnn!nneitgeistnn aboratory for crypo-native products/protocolsnnuilding a crypto-native product, protocol, or public good is no easy feat. ne needs to navigate a terrain of non-trivial trade-offs and questions, both in technical domains (e.g. building secure smart contract systems) and operational domains (e.g. structuring legal and onchain entities). oreover, the ecosystem is young and the right answers to these questions are evolving over time.nnhis is where eitgeist steps in. very season, they bring together a community of innovative builders to dive into the obstacles coming up across the group and build together at no cost. he program is structured and accepts a small number of projects, thus facilitating meaningful cross-team collaboration where members can learn from one another across domains and receive hands-on support from advisors and alumni.nneitgeist seasons are run online and open to teams located anywhere in the world. o date, there have been builders from the , anada, erlin, msterdam, arcelona, uenos ires, and ingapore. he team also recognizes the effectiveness of in-person time in building personal relationships, hence they meet and have working sessions in different parts of the world.nn kicked off last ctober with ten teams coming together to build a variety of projects with different focuses, ranging from infrastructure powered by multiparty computation to  rollups. o learn
