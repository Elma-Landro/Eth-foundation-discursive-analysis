Titre: Ethereum turns 5 🎂\nAuteur: Ethereum Foundation Team\nDate: Team on July 30, 2020\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/07/30/ethereum-turns-5\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nive years ago today, thereum's genesis block marked the official network launch.nnoday, most members of the community spend their time thinking about all of the work that's left to be done, but it's also important to recognize on this fifth anniversary of thereum's launch just how unbelievably far we have all come, what a wild adventure every twist and turn has been, and how much all of us (and the technology) have grown.nnhere were times when somennhopednnthat the protocol would just run as intended, or that builders might try to launch the first applications, that users would want to try out those applications, or that someone might some day use thereum to create real and positive impact.nno while the focus will stay on all that's left to do, it would have been hard five years ago to imagine all of the thinkers, doers, students, governments, enterprises and other innovators that are making real and impactful change using thereum today. he same is true of all of the unepected bumps, forks, the incredible meetups/events, memes and passionate debates seen along the way none of us around this community would be where we are today if not for thosenn“unepected”nnmoments 😉.nnveryone that makes up thereum’s ecosystem once waited for the first contracts to come online. oday there are millions! nd we've long since lost track of the number of applications that are now unmapped stars to us. t's hard for the most dedicated followers to keep track of even the protocol-level innovations taking place.nnn these five years, thereum has grown beyond any builder, team, or organization, but hopefully you're as inspired as ever to keep working together to help thereum become everything that we all dream for it to be and more. 🦄nn--nnthereum oundation eam
