catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe following is an update from et illion ellow ulenga apwepwe and her initiative "ummitshare". or more about the et illion ellowship rogram and to apply, please visitnnhttps//nbn.ethereum.foundation/nn.nnulenga apwepwenn, founder of thennomen’s istory useum of ambiannposed a question in  to a small group of younger tech enthusiasts in ambia an something called “blockchain technology” offer any new usefulness for the preservation of history he had started a new initiative aimed atnndigital humanitiesnn, and engaging with young people ecited by technology who might want to apply their talents to the world of arts, culture, and history. he group of developers, designers, and artists she was working with shared their enthusiasm for “web”, and together they discussed some of the properties and features of blockchains. o she began to consider how they might apply it to a truly challenging problem for frican eritage artifact repatriation.nnistorically, many regions around the world have seen their material cultural heritage housed in uropean and merican museums, raising comple questions about ownership, history, and identity. n the frican contet, this issue is particularly pronounced an estimatednn% of frica's material cultural heritagennis now located in the est, according to the  arr and avoy reportnnhe estitution of frican ultural eritage oward a ew elational thicsnnnn.nnhile discussions around physical repatriation have persisted for years, geopolitical and logistical compleities often make tangible steps toward resolution difficult.nnhe group had an idea if the physical repatriation of artifacts is too bound up in geopolitical, cultural and logistical challenges, perhaps it would be possible to create anndigital castnnof the artifacts as a viable alternative. y linking a digital artifact to its physical original, this method might capture and evoke a similar connection to heritage, creativity, history, and the invaluable knowledge and lessons of the past that museum patrons eperience in person, while also offering a new perspective on the physical artifacts—forming innovative ways to connect with cultural heritage. ith the right supporting technology, frican artifacts currently locked away in uropean and merican museums could become accessible to fricans whose ancestors took part in creating them.nnirtual and augmented reality technology has advanced enough to enable high-fidelity scans of physical objects, allowing them to be displayed on screens, projectors, or  goggles in a museum ehibition. owever, the scanned objects still need that essential property ofnnuniquenessnnin order to have a meaningful sense of provenance connected to the real thing. f artifacts housed in distant museums could be scanned, minted, and ehibited as unique, provenance-verified digital items, researchers, curators, and museum patrons could engage with the artifacts in new ways. oreover, social coordination around these digital artifacts could enable meaningful interactions, allowing communities and eperts to collectively manage, share, and research cultural heritage in new ways.nnmagine ticket revenue from an ehibition on southern frican masks in russels (or aris, or ondon) directly benefiting communities in usaka (or arare, or retoria)—communities with real, tangible connections to the artifacts. or many community members who may never have the opportunity to see the objects in person, this digital access could allow them to contribute personal memories or unique cultural contet that researchers and anthropologists may have never known. uch contributions could help "recontetualize" these artifacts, restoring meaning and relevance to items that have often been displayed without the voices and perspectives of those most closely connected to them.nnhrough the sparks of curiosity that began with this question, the team laid the first foundational blocks of a new approach to cultural preservation one that connects the heritage of the past with the technology of the present, bringing it to those who hold it most dear.nn istory achinennenkatesh aonn, in a talk titled “nnbloodcoinnn”, described blockchains as “a history technology”. hey provide a permanent, accessible medium to inscribe history on a ledger that does not fade or distort over time. his makes blockchains annnideal toolnnornntechnologynnfor museums and anthropologists. lockchains also happen to be an efficient way to enact “money” and other systems that function as mediums of echange, unit(s) of account, and store(s) of value. hese properties might allow blockchains to become a medium capable of “injecting history” into records of value and ownership to preserve and acknowledge narratives of historical debts and reparations.nno eplore this potential, ulenga apwepwe, along withnnhomas ondwenn,nnhyira mofa-ekyinn, andnnario erenn, co-founded ummithare. ogether, they set out to develop innovative, digital methods to address the comple realities of history. ummithare’s approach emphasizes interactive, participatory, and educational eperiences—bridging the past with a digitally fluent audience and providing meaningful connections to cultural heritage through modern technology.nnn the same way that the internet radically transformed how information spreads, blockchains might transform how history is preserved, offering a form ofnntemporal permanence.nny creating digital representations of artifacts and inscribing their provenance — their journey through societies and time — ummithare democratizes access to cultural heritage. any artifacts in uropean museums today lack complete provenance, but living communities may hold valuable contet (songs, stories, memories) that could deepen understanding and restore meaning. igital casts of artifacts ensure this contet is preserved while also enabling heritage communities to share in the benefits these objects generate.nnroof of oncept rigins with the nnhrough a collaboration facilitated by the omen’s istory useum of ambia, the ummithare team engaged with thennwedish thnographic useumnnto access their catalog and digital repository of artifacts. his partnership provided ummithare with valuable resources, including access to digital records containing provenance information and initial  casts of artifacts held in the wedish museum’s collection. everaging these resources, the team began designing and modeling a  virtual ehibit featuring artifacts with rich historical contets from ambia and southern frica. eyond the digital modeling, the project also proposed tokenizing these artifacts to encode and preserve their provenance, marking a significant step toward the creation of a decentralized digital repository.nnevelopment and rowth nder thereum’s et illion ellowship rogramnnn , ulenga (as lead of the ummithare team) joined the thereum oundation’s et illion ellowship rogram, allowing them to refine the project. he project gained valuable open-source contributions for smart contract and initial subgraph design from a pseudonymous contributor, and fromnnanan aj hmednn, a alestinian designer, who contributed early work amidst significant challenges in aza. aniel embo, a skilled  artist with a background in game design, serves as the architect of ummithare’s virtual realm, and crafted virtual ehibition environments to bring artifacts to life in immersive digital format.nnhe eading adies hibit  odel for igital and hysical ollaborationnnhroughout , the ummithare team has prepared for its inaugural ehibit, furthering research on local repatriation efforts and forming key partnerships, including with the ctant ccelerator to scale the platform. his ehibit, titlednneading adies,nnfocuses on the lives and artifacts of si ambian women—trailblazers from various societal roles, such as generals, political activists, and tribal leaders. hese artifacts provide unique historical insights and inspiration for modern society.nnith ummithare, museums and galleries can create ehibitions with both physical and digital elements, each connected through smart contracts. his allows for unique synergies, such as ticket sales for uropean ehibitions supporting cultural programs in frica, combining digital artifacts with tangible benefits for heritage communities.nnn ehibit on ummithare is not just a set of images and models of art pieces or objects – they are linked to a set of smart contracts that provide a unique tag to the object and allow it to be represented on the internet of value. ith the ummithare smart contracts, we get the provenance and uniqueness needed for that meaningful connection to a digital item.nnoreover, the platform also uses the same set of contracts to manage ticket sales as well as interactive features of the ehibit that relate to the digitized objects. uration fees, proceeds, benefits, and the relationship between them are all structured to return value to all custodians of heritage and cultural value, historically and geographically.nnhenneading adiesnnehibit holds a special association with ambia’s wembe alley community, highlighting the cultural origins of the artifacts. he goal is to ensure that the wembe alley community directly benefits from the ehibit’s proceeds and engagement.nnefore launching this ehibit, the ummithare team met with wembe alley leaders to understand their preservation methods, governance, and information-sharing practices, which informed how the platform integrates traditional governance into decision-making processes.nnhe wembe alley’s support etends tonn communitiesnnwithin their jurisdiction, offering an incredible opportunity for ummithare to reach a broad, interconnected audience.nnorward-looking istorynnummithare isn’t just about frican heritage, it’s about using human coordination to solve the global issue of cultural disconnection. y placing history and culture onchain, we create an immutable record and a bridge between past and present, preserving legacies while empowering heritage communities.nnt its core, ummithare focuses onnnprovenancenn(information) andnnpeoplenn. hese guiding principles drive its mission to bridge gaps in access, knowledge, and representation. his journey is one of research, eperimentation, and the design of systems that enable democratized access to cultural and economic components that have long been out of reach.nnhenneading adies hibitnnis now
