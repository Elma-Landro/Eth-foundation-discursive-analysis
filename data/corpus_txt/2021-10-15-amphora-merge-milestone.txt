Titre: Amphora: A Major Merge Milestone\nAuteur: Tim Beiko\nDate: October 15, 2021\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/10/15/amphora-merge-milestone\nCat√©gorie: Non cat√©goris√©\n\n==================================================\n\narlier this year, thennayonism hackathonnnkicked off to protoype the architecture for thereum's transition to proof of stake. he transition, often refered to as he erge, will keep the eisting beacon chain (eth) and eecution layer (eth) clients, and "merge" both chains by making the beacon chain drive the eecution layer's consensus. his approach is the most recent in a series of iterations to the thereum roadmap (more on thatnnherenn).nnhile ayonism proved that this was a sound architecture, there were still several things left to design, implement and test, including the actual proof of work (o) to proof of stake (o) transition. o do so, client teams met face to face last week (analogous to thennth nterop from nn) for a workshop named mphora üè∫.nnere is an overview of the main things that were accomplished during the workshop, and the path from here to he erge.nnmphora ilestonesnnhe purpose of the event was to get the eecution and consensus layer client teams to iron out outstanding issues in the specification and reach a set of development milestones. ach milestone got clients closer to a fully functioning merge devnet which transitioned from o to o. epresentatives of esu, rigon, thereum, eth, ethermind, imbus, ighthouse, odestar, uilt and eku attended the workshop in person. he rysm team, along with several members from the aforementioned teams, participated remotely.nnhennmphora ilestonesnnaimed to first get clients conforming with the spec, then gradually adding more compleity and finally growing the amount of other clients they could interoperate with.nnhe first milestone, , only required clients to implement the merge specification. t was completed by most teams prior to the workshop even starting! o help clients validate their implementation,nnseveralnn-nntestingnn-nnsuitesnnwere provided.nnhen, milestones ,  and  had client teams set up devnets with an increasing technical compleity and node diversity.  had eecution layer () and consensus layer () teams pair one on one, and launch a post-merge devnet. his ensured that both layers could successfully communicate via thennngine nnin a o contet.nn is where the mphora workshop moved a step beyond ayonism clients set up emphemeral devnets which ran through the o to o transition.nnhe transition is based on o difficulty once a block's difficulty equals or eceeds a specific value, callednn__nn, ornnnn, it is considered the final o block. he eecution layer then begins listening to the o consensus layer for new blocks. o ensure that each team's implementation was robust,  teams had to connect to two  clients and vice-versa to pass .nn was the real target for the event to get multiple  &  clients on a devnet which went through the entire o to o transition. n other words, while  was about one-to-one devnets,  was about many-to-many.nne achieved this for a subset of the teams before the end of the workshop, so we then went for our stretch goal .nnasting rtifactsnnhis milestone aimed to turn mphora from a short-lived event to long(er)-lived infrastructure that the community could use.  required client teams to start a devnet that would not only run through the entire transition with all client combinations, but that would persist beyond the mphora event.nnn the last day of the workshop, minutes before the final dinner was served,  was hit a network of , validators across  nodes and several client implementations launched under o, reached thenn__nn, transitioned to o, and successfully finalized the chain üéâ!nnhe  devnet successfully finalizes post-merge, minutes before the workshop's closing dinner. hoto by en dgington.nneyond mphorannmphora's success provides great momentum for he erge. lient teams now have annclear list of tasksnnthey need to work toward, and enough progress has been made to begin reaching out to a larger segment of the thereum community.nnesterday, a more stable version of the  mphora devnet,nnithosnn, was launched. ow that this network is live (eplorernnherenn), epect public calls eploring how developer tools and other core thereum infrastructure can best prepare for the o to o transition.nnlient teams and researchers will keep iterating on he erge specification to fi issues identified during mphora and respond to feedback from the community. ithin a few weeks the spec should be finalized and, soon after, a new stable testnet made available.nnhank younnhe work accomplished during mphora eceeded all of our epectations. or this, we want to thank the client teams and researchers, without whom, none of the specifications would have been written or implemented.nndditionaly, thanks tonnonsenysnn,nnhainsafennandnnen dgingtonnnfor their ecellent coverage of the workshop.
