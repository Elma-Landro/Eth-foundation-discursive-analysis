Titre: Hard Fork No. 4: Spurious Dragon\nAuteur: Hudson Jameson\nDate: Jameson on November 18, 2016\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/18/hard-fork-no-4-spurious-dragon\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe thereum network will be undergoing a hard fork at block number ,,, which will likely occur between  and   on uesday, ovember , .  countdown timer can be seen atnnhttps//fork.codetract.io/nn. he orden test network will be undergoing a hard fork at block number ,,.nns a user, what do  need to donnownload the latest version of your thereum clientnnatest version of thereum allet/ist (v..)nnatest geth client (v..)nnatest arity client (v..)nnatest ruby-ethereum client (v..)nnhat happens if  do not update my clientnnf you are using an thereum client that is not updated for the upcoming hard fork, your client will sync to the pre-fork blockchain once the fork occurs. ou will be stuck on an incompatible chain following the old rules and you will be unable to send ether or operate on the post-fork thereum network.nnmportantly, if your client is not updated, it also means that any transactions you make will still be susceptible to replay attacks.nnhat if  am using a web or mobile thereum wallet like ytherallet or annthereum websites and mobile applications that allow you to store ether and/or make transactions are running their own thereum client infrastructure to facilitate their services. enerally, you do not need to do anything if you use a third party web based or mobile thereum wallet. owever, you should still check with your web or mobile thereum wallet provider to see what actions they are taking to update for the hard fork and if they are asking their users to take other steps.nnn particular, you should ensure that transactions are generated with the new replay-protected   scheme.nnhat do  do if my thereum client is having trouble syncing to the blockchainnnake sure you have downloaded the latest version of your thereum client.nnf you are using eth or ist,nnrefer to this thereum tackchange threadnn.nnf you are using arity,nnrefer to this section of the arity wikinn.nnhy are we proposing to hard fork the networknn"purious ragon" is the second hard fork of the two-round hard fork response to the o attacks on the thereum network in eptember and ctober. he previous hard fork (a.k.a "angerine histle")nnaddressed immediate network health issues due to the attacksnn. he upcoming hard fork addresses important but less pressing matters such as further tuning opcode pricing to prevent future attacks on the network, enabling "debloat" of the blockchain state, and adding replay attack protection.nnhat changes are a part of this hard forknnhe followingnnthereum mprovement roposals (s)nndescribe the protocol changes implemented in this hard fork.nn  eplay attack protectionnn- prevents transactions from one thereum chain from being rebroadcasted on an alternative chain. or eample f you send  test ether to someone from the orden testnet, that same transaction cannot be replayed on the main thereum chain.nnmportant notenn  isnnbackwards compatiblenn, so transactions generated with the "pre-purious-ragon" format will still be accepted. owever, to ensure you are protected against replay attacks, you will still need to use a wallet solution that implements  .
e aware that this backwards compatibility also means that transactions created from alternative thereum based blockchains that have not implemented   (such as thereum lassic) can still be replayed on the main thereum chain.nn   cost increasenn- adjusts the price of `` opcode so it balances the price of `` with the computational compleity of the operation, essentially making it more difficult to slow down the network via computationally epensive contract operations.nn  tate trie clearingnn- makes it possible to remove a large number of empty accounts that were put in the state at very low cost as a result of earlier o attacks. ith this , 'empty' accounts are removed from the state whenever 'touched' by another transaction. emoval of the empty accounts greatly reduces blockchain state size, which will provide client optimizations such as faster sync times. he actual removal process will begin after the fork by systematically performing `` to the empty accounts that were created by the attacks.nn  ontract code size limitnn- changes the maimum code size that a contract on the blockchain can have. his update prevents an attack scenario where large pieces of account code can be accessed repeatedly at a fied gas cost. he maimum size has been set to  bytes, which is larger than any currently deployed contract.nnnnhis is an emergent and evolving highly technical space. f you choose to implement the recommendations in this post and continue to participate, you should make sure you understand how it impacts you. ou should understand that there are risks involved including but not limited to risks like unepected bugs. y choosing to implement these recommendations, you alone assume the risks of the consequences.
