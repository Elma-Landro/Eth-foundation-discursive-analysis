Titre: Gav’s Ethereum ÐΞV Update IV\nAuteur: Gavin Wood\nDate: December 15, 2014\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/12/15/gavs-ethereum-dev-update-iv\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nime for another update! o quite a bit has happened following ÐΞcon-, our internal developer's conference. he conference itself was a great time to get all the developers together and really get to know each other, dissipate annlotnnof information (back to back presentations for  days!) and chat over a lot of ideas. he comms team will be releasing each of the presentations as fast as an can get them nicely polished.nnuring the time since the last update, much has happened including, finally, the release of the thereum ÐΞ website, ethdev.com. hough relatively simple as present, there are great plans to etend this into a developer's portal in which you'll be able to browse the bug bounty programme, look at and, ultimately follow tutorials, look up documentation, find the latest binaries for each platform and see the progress of builds.nns usual  have been mostly between witzerland, the  and erlin, during this time. ow that ÐΞ-erlin is settled in the hub, we have a great collaboration space in which volunteers can work, collaborate, bond and socialise alongside our more formal hires. f late,  have been working to finish up the formal specification of thereum, the ellow aper, and make it up to date with the latest protocol changes in order that the security audit get underway. ogether we have been putting the finishing touches on seventh, and likely final, proof-of-concept code, delayed largely due to a desire to make it the final o release for protocol changes. 've also been doing some nice core refactoring and documentation, specifically removing two long standing dislikes of mine, the tatecreate and tatecall methods and making the tate class nicer for creating custom states useful when developing contracts. ou can epect to see the fruits of this work in ilestone  of i, thereum's official .nnngoing ecruitmentnnn that note, 'm happy to announce that we have hired rkadiy aronyan, a talented developer originally from ussia who will be working with ann on the i . e's got off to a great start on his first week helping on the front-end with the second milestone. 'm also very pleased to announce that we hired ustav imonsson. eing an epert rlang with o eperience with considerable epertise in network programming and security reviewing, he will initially be working with utta on the o code base security audit before joining the o team.nne also have another two recruits imitri hoklov and ason olby.  first met ason in the fateful week back last anuary when the early thereum collaborators got together for a week before the orth merican itcoin conference where italik gave the first public talk about thereum. ason, who has moved to erlin from his home in ew ampshire, is mostly working alongside eron and hristian to help to look after the hub and looking after various bits of administration that need to be done. imitri, who works from ver in ussia is helping flesh out our unit tests with hristoph, ultimately aiming towards full code coverage.nne have several more recruits that 'd love to mention but can't announce quite yet - watch this space... (nnngoing rojectsnn'm happy to say that after a busy weekend, arek, aktu, ick and ven have managed to get the uild ot, our  system, building on all three platforms cleanly again.  special shout goes out to arek who tirelessly fought with ake and  to bend the indows platform to his will. ell done to all involved.nnhristian continues to power through on the olidity project, aided now by efteris who is focusing on parsing and packaging the atpec documentation. he latest feature to be added allows for the creation of new contracts in a beautiful manner with thennnewnnkeyword. le and ven are beginning to work on the project of introducing network well-formedness into the pp subsystem using the salient parts of the well-proven ademlia  design. e should begin seeing some of this stuff in the code base within before the year-end.nn'm also happy to announce that the first successful message was sent between o & ++ clients on our messaging/hash-table hybrid system, codenamed hisper. hough only at an early proof-of-concept stage, the  is reasonably robust and fied, so largely ready to prototype applications on.nnew rojectsnnarian is the lucky guy who has been tasked with developing out what will be our awesome web-based & deck. his will provide a public website whose back-end connects to a bunch of nodes around the world and displays real-time information on network status including chain length and a chain-fork early warning system. hough accessible by anyone, we will of course have a dedicated monitor on at all times for this page at the hub.nnven, utta and eiko have also begun a most interesting and important project the thereum stress-testing project. esigned to study and test the network in a range of real-life adverse situations prior to release, they will construct infrastructure allowing the setup of many (s, s, even s of) nodes each individually remote-controllable and able to simulate circumstances such as  attacks, net splits, rogue clients, arrival and departure of large amounts of hash-power and measure attributes like block & transaction propagation times and patterns, uncle rates and fork lengths.  project to watch out for.nnonclusionsnnhe net time  write this  hope to have released o- and be on the way to the alpha release (not to mention have the ellow aper out).  epect eff will be doing an update concerning the o side of things soon enough. ntil then, watch out for the o- release and mine some testnet ther!
