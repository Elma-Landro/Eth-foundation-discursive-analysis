Titre: Final Steps\nAuteur: Stephan Tual\nDate: July 27, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/07/27/final-steps\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nn update as promised all systems are now ‘o’ on the technical side (pun intended) and we intend to release rontier this week.nnhank you to everyone who provided feedback on my previous blog post. hat became apparent is that prior to the big day, many of you wanted to know more about what the sequence of events would eactly be, and how to prepare your machine for the release.nn transparent and open releasennrontier users will need to first generate, then load the enesis block into their thereum client. he enesis block is pretty much a database file it contains all the transactions from the ther sale, and when a user inputs it into the client, it represents their decision to join the network under its terms it is the first step to consensus.nnecause the ether pre-sale took place entirely on the bitcoin blockchain, its contents arennpublicnn, and anyone can generate and verify the enesis block. n the interest of decentralization and transparency, thereum will not provide the enesis block as a download, but instead has created an open source script that anyone can use to generate the file, a link to which can be found later on in this article.nnince the script is already available and the release needs to be coordinated, an argument to the script has to be provided in order to 'kick off' rontier in unison. ut how can we do thisnnandnnstay decentralizednnhe argument needs to be a random parameter that no one, not even us, can predict. s you can imagine, there aren’t too many parameters in the world that match this criteria, but a good one is the hash of a future block on the thereum testnet. e had to pick a block number, but which one ,, turns out to be both prime and palindromic, just the way we like it. o # is it.nnequence of steps to the releasenninal steps to the release revealed ou are reading this now.nnlock # is formed on the thereum tesnet, and is given a hash.nnhe hash is used by users around the world as a unique parameter to the enesis block generation script.nnhat you can do todaynnirst, you’ll need the client installed, ’ll use eth as an eample, but the same can be achieved withnnthnn(the ++ implementation of thereum). eth installation instructions for indows, inu and  can be found on ournnwikinn.nnnce you have installed a client, you need to download the python script that generates the enesis file. t’s called 'mk_genesis_block.py', and can be downloadednnherenn.nnepending on your platform, you can also download it from the console by installing curl and runningnncurlnn- https//raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/genesis_block_generator/master/mk_genesis_block.pynnhis will create the file in the same folder where you invoked the command. ou now need to install the pybitcointools created by our very own italik uterin. ou can obtain this through the python package manager pip, so we’ll install pip first, then the tools right afterwards.nnhe following instructions should work on  and inu. indows users, good news, pip ships with the standardnnython installernn.nncurlnn- https//bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.pynnsudonnpython get-pip.pynnsudonnpipnninstallnnbitcoinnnor (if you had it installed already),nnsudonnpipnninstallnn--upgrade bitcoinnnne last step, if you are using th, we recently to support the new enesis block parameter, so you'll need to pick up the correct release of the software to be ready for the big daynncdnn~/go-ethereum/nngitnncheckout release/..nngitnnpullnnmakenngethnnhose who would like to be ‘as ready as possible’ can follow instructions up to this point, that said, anngit pullnnjust before the fateful block is probably recommended to operate the newest version of any software.nnf you have been running the clients beforennack up your keys (maybe some of them are eligible for lympic rewards) - they are located in ./ethereum/keystorennelete your old chain please (it's located in ./ethereum, delete the following  folders only ./etra, ./state, ./blockchain)nnou can safely leave your ./ethereum/nodes, ./ethereum/history and ./ethereum/nodekey in placennaving s pregenerated in ./ethash will not hurt, but feel free to delete them if you need the spacennor a complete breakdown as to where the config files are located, please check out thisnnpagennon our forums.nnhen, it's a matter of waiting for block #, which at the current block resolution time, should be formed approimately hursday evening +.nnnce  has formed, its hash will be accessible by querying a node running the testnet usingnnweb.eth.getlock().hashnn, however we will also make that value available on this blog as well as all ournnsocialnnmediannchannelsnn.nnou will then be able to generate the enesis block by runningnnpython mk_genesis_block.py --etradata hash_for_nn#_goes_here  genesis_block.jsonnny default, the script uses lockr and lockchain.info to fetch the enesis pre-sale results. ou can also add thenn--insightnnswitch if you’d instead prefer to use the private thereum server to obtain this information. f you are facing issues with the script, please raise an issue on itsnngithubnn.nnhile we will not provide the enesis block as a file, we will still provide the enesis block hash (shortly after we generate it ourselves) in order to insure that third party invalid or malicious files are easily discarded by the community.nnnce you are satisfied with the generation of the enesis block, you can load it into the clients using this commandnn./build/bin/geth --genesis genesis_block.jsonnnornn./build/eth/eth --genesis genesis_block.jsonnnrom there, instructions on creating an account, importing your pre-sale wallet, transacting, etc., can be found on the ‘etting tarted’ rontier guide atnnhttp//guide.ethereum.org/nnote that if you've used thereum before, you should generate new keys using a recent () client, and not reuse testnet keys.nn couple more things…nne also would like to give you a bit of heads up on the ‘thawing’ phase -- the period during which the gas limit per block will be set very low to allow the network to grow slowly before transactions can take place. ou should epect network instability at the very beginning of the release, including forks, potential abnormal display of information on ournnhttp//stats.ethdev.comnnpage, and various eer to eer connectivity issues. ust like during the lympic phase, we epect this instability to settle after a few hours/days.nne would also like to remind everyone that while we intend to provide a safe platform in the long term, rontier is a technical release directed at a developer audience, and not a general public release. lease keep in mind that early software is often affected by bugs, issues with instability and comple user interfaces. f you would prefer a more user friendly eperience, we encourage you to wait for the future omestead or etropolis thereum releases.nnlease be especially wary of third party websites and software of unknown origin -- thereum will only ever publish software through its github platform atnnhttps//github.com/ethereum/nn.nninally, for clarity, it’s important to note that thennlympicnnprogram ended at block  this morning, however, the bug bounty is still on --- and will continue until further notice. ecurity vulnerabilities, if found, should continue to be reported tonnhttps//bounty.ethdev.com/nn.nn--nnpdatesnn//nn added instructions for users upgrading from previous installationsnn//nn minor edits, added link to script githubnn//nn added recommendation to create new keys and not reuse testnet ones
