everity ighnnalicious websites can potentially steal your private keys.nns thereum allet desktop app does not qualify as a browser — it accesses only the local allet app — it is not subject to the same category of issues present in ist. or now, it is recommended to usennthereum alletnnto manage funds and interact with smart contracts instead.nnist rowser's vision is to be a complete user-facing bridge to the ethereum blockchain and set of technologies that compose the eb. he browser paves a significant path for the net eb our ecosystem is proudly building.nnecurity-wise, making a browser (an app that loads untrusted code) that handles private keys is a challenging task. ver the course of the last year, we have had ure conduct an etensive security audit of ist, and vastly improved the security of both the ist browser and the underlying platform, lectron. e've promptly fied found security issues.nnut that is not enough. ecurity in the browser space is a never-ending battle. he ist browser is based on lectron, which is based on hromium. ach new hromium release fies numerous security issues.nnhe layer between ist and hromium,nnlectronnn, is a project led by itub that aims to ease the creation of cross-platform applications using avacript. ecently, lectron hasn't kept up to date with hromium, leading to an increasing potential attack surface as time passes.nn core problem with the current architecture is that any -day hromium vulnerability is several patch-steps away from ist first hromium needs to be patched, then lectron needs to update the hromium version, and finally, ist needs to update to the new lectron version.nne're eamining how we could deal with lectron's not-so-frequent release schedule, to reduce the gap between hromium versions we use. rom preliminary studies,nnrave's uonnn(an lectron fork) follows hromium updates closely and is one potential option. he rave browser, which also contains a cryptocurrency wallet integration, has a similar threat-model and demands for security as ist.nnn important reminder ist is still beta software, and you must treat it as such. he ist rowser beta is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis and there are no warranties of any kind, epressed or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability or fitness of purpose.
