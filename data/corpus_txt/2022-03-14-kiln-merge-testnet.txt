Titre: Announcing the Kiln Merge Testnet\nAuteur: Protocol Support Team\nDate: March 14, 2022\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/03/14/kiln-merge-testnet\nCat√©gorie: Non cat√©goris√©\n\n==================================================\n\nhennintsugi üçµ merge testnetnn, launched late ecember, has been a valuable testing ground for he erge. hrough various test suites, multi-client devnets, shadow forks of oerli, application deployments, and the community's help #estingheerge, we've arrived at a set of stable and robust protocol specifications. ow that clients have implemented these latest specs, a successor to intsugi, iln üî•üß±, is being launched!nnike the thereum mainnet, iln's eecution layer was launched under proof-of-work in parallel to a eacon hain running proof-of-stake. he erge happened on iln on arch , . he network is now running entirely under proof-of-stake!nniln is epected to be the last merge testnet created before eisting public testnets are upgraded. pplication & tooling developers, node operators, infrastructure providers and stakers are strongly encouraged to test on iln to ensure a smooth transition on eisting public testnets.nnintsugi, the previous merge testnet, will be deprecated in the coming weeks.nnsing ilnnnetting tartednnhe easiest way to get started using iln is to visit the network'snnlanding pagenn. here, you can add the network to your browser wallet, view block eplorers, request funds from the faucet, and connect to a   endpoint. f you'd like to be a validator on iln, thennstaking launchpadnnalso supports the network.nnpplication & ooling evelopersnnith iln going live, now is the time to ensure that your product works as epected through the proof-of-stake transition and in a post-merge contet. s eplained in annprevious postnn, he erge will have only minimal impacts on a subset contracts deployed on thereum, none of which should be breaking. dditionally, the lion's share of user  endpoints remain stable (that is, unless you are using o specific methods such asnneth_getorknn).nnhat said, most applications on thereum involve much more than on-chain contracts. iln is where you want to make sure that your front end code, tooling, deployment pipeline and other off-chain components work as intended. e strongly recommend that developers run through a full testing & deployment cycle on iln and report any issues with tools or dependencies to those projects' maintainers. f you are unsure about where to open an issue, please usennthis repositorynn.nnode peratorsnnost-merge, an thereum full node will be the combination of a consensus layer client, which runs proof-of-stake on the eacon hain, and an eecution layer client, which manages the user-state and runs the computations associated with transactions. hese communicate over an authenticated port using a new set of   methods, called thennngine nn.nnode operators will thus need to run both a consensus and eecution layer client in tandem. n other words, if you were already running a node on the eacon hain, you now need to also run an eecution layer client. imilarly, if you were running a node on the current proof-of-work network, you will need to run a consensus layer client.nnou can find the latest iln-supported release of clientsnnherenn.nnt is worth emphasizing that each layer will maintain an independent set of peers and epose its own s. henneaconnnandnn nns will thus both continue working as epected.nntakersnns eplained above, validators on the eacon hain will need to run an eecution layer client after he erge. re-merge, this was strongly recommended, but it was possible for validators to outsource these functions to third party providers. his was possible because the only data required on the eecution layer were updates to the deposit contract.nnost-merge, validators need to ensure that transactions in blocks they create and attest to are valid. o do so, an eecution layer client is required. hile this epands validators' responsibilities, it also gives a validator who proposes a block the right to its associated transaction priority fees (which currently go to miners).nnhile validator rewards accrue on the eacon hain and will require a subsequent upgrade to be withdrawn, transaction fees will continue to be paid, burned, and distributed on the eecution layer. alidators can thus specify any thereum address as a receipient for transaction fees.nniln is the perfect environment for eisting stakers to familiarise themselves with the post-merge thereum contet. e recommend trying to mirror your production setup on the network and ensuring that you work through any issues now.nngain, thennstaking launchpadnnprovides a simple interface to get started. ote that as part ofnnthe renaming away from "eth."nn, thennethereum/eth.-deposit-clinnrepository will soon be renamed tonnethereum/staking-deposit-clinn.nnnnwen mergenn date for the thereum mainnet proof-of-stake transition hasnnnotnnbeen set as of the publication of this post. ny source claiming otherwise is likely to be a scam. pdates will be posted on this blog. lease stay safe!nnssuming no issues are found with iln, once clients have finalized the details of their implementations, the eisting thereum testnets (oerli, opsten, etc.) will run through he erge. nce these have successfully transitioned and stabilized, again, assuming no issues are found, anndifficulty valuennwill be set for the mainnet transition. nly then will it be possible to estimate the eact date for he erge.nns an thereum user or ther holder, is there anything  need to donno. f you want to try out iln, please do. e hope many community members will join us in #estingheerge on iln.nnhe thereum mainnet is not affected by this testnet. ubsequent announcements will be made on this blog prior to mainnet's transition.nns a miner, is there anything  need to donno. f you are mining on the thereum mainnet, you should be aware that after he erge, the network will operate completely under proof-of-stake. t that point, mining will no longer be possible on the network.nns a validator, can  withdraw my stakenno. he erge is the most complicated upgrade to thereum to date. n order to minimize risks of network disruptions, a minimal approach was taken which ecluded any non-transition changes from this upgrade.nnithdrawals from the eacon hain will likely be available as of the first upgrade after he erge. pecifications for both thennconsensusnnandnneecutionnnlayers are in progress.nnhy ilnnnhe previous merge testnet, intsugi, was named after the apanese art of breaking pottery and fiing it using gold, making it both stronger and more beautiful.nnn a similar vein, a iln is a high-temperature oven used to turn clay into hardened objects, such as pottery or bricks üî•üß±.
