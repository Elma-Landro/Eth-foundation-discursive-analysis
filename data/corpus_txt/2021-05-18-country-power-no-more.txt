Titre: Ethereum's energy usage will soon decrease by ~99.95%\nAuteur: Carl Beekhuizen\nDate: May 18, 2021\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nthereum will use at least ~.% less energy post merge.nnthereum will be completing the transition to roof-of-take in the upcoming months, which brings a myriad of improvements that have been theorized for years. ut now that the eacon chain has been running for a few months, we can actually dig into the numbers. ne area that we're ecited to eplore involves new energy-use estimates, as we end the process of epending a country's worth of energy on consensus.nnhere aren't any concrete statistics on energy consumption (or even what hardware is used) as of yet, so what follows is a ball-park estimation of the energy consumption of the future of thereum.nns many people are running multiple validators, 've decided to use the number of unique addresses that made deposits as a proy for how many servers are out there today. any stakers could have used multiple eth addresses, but this largely cancels out against those with redundant setups.nnt the time of writing, there are , validators from , unique addresses. bviously this is heavily skewed by echanges and staking services, so removing them leaves , validators assumed to be staking from home. s a sanity check, this implies that the average home-staker runs . validators which seems like a reasonable estimate to me.nnower equirementsnnow much power does it take to run a beacon node (), . validator clients (), and an eth full-node sing my personal setup as a base, it's around  watt. oe lapis (a ocket ool dev) recently ran  s, a imbus , and a eth full node off of a h  battery bank for  hours, meaning that this setup averaged . t is unlikely that the average staker is running such an optimised setup, so let's call it  all in.nnultiplying this with the k validators from before means that home-stakers consume ~. megawatt. stimating the power consumed by custodial stakers is a bit harder, they run tens of thousands of validator clients with redundancy and backups.nno make life easy, let's also just assume that they use  per . validators. ased off of the staking infrustructure teams  have spoken to, this is anngrossnnover-estimate. he real answer is something like  less (nd if you are a custodial staking team consuming more than / validator hit me up, 'm sure  can help you out).nnn total, a roof-of-take thereum therefore consumes something on the order of . megawatt. his is not on the scale of countries, provinces, or even cities, but that of a small town (around  merican homes).nnor reference, roof-of-ork (o) consensus on thereum currently consumes the energy equivalent of a medium-sized country, but this is actually necessary to keep a o chain safe. s the name suggests, o reaches consensus based off of which fork has the most "work" done on it. here are two ways to increase the rate of "work" being done, increase the efficiency of mining hardware and using more hardware at the same time. o prevent a chain from being successfully attacked, miners must be doing "work" at a rate greater than an attacker could. s an attacker is likely to have similar hardware, miners must keep large amounts of efficient hardware running to prevent an attacker from out-mining them and all this hardware uses a lot of power.nnnder o, as the price of  and the hashrate are positively correlated. herefore, as as the price increases, in equilibrium so too does the power consumed by the network. nder roof-of-take, when the price of  increases, the security of the network does too (the value of the  at-stake is worth more), but the energy requirements remain unchanged.nnome comparisonsnnigiconomist estimatesnnthat thereum miners currently consume . h per year which works out to . gigawatt on a continuing basis. his means that o is ~ more energy efficient based on the conservative estimates above, which reflects a reduction of at least .% in total energy use.nnf energy consumption per-transaction is more your speed, that's ~h/t (avg ~ gas/t) or about  minutes of . y contrast, thereum o uses the equivalent energy of a house for . days per transaction and itcoin consumes  house-days worth.nnooking orwardnnhile thereum continues to use o for now, that won't be the case for much longer. n the past few weeks,nnwe have seennnthe emergence of the first testnets fornnhe ergenn, the name given to the moment thereum switches to from o to o. everal teams of engineers are working overtime to ensure thatnnhe ergennarrives as soon as possible, and without compromising on safety.nncaling solutions (such as rollups and sharding) will help further decrease the energy consumed per-transaction by leveraging economies of scale.nnthereum's power-hungry days are numbered, and  hope that's true for the rest of the industry too.nnhanks to oseph chweitzer, anny yan, acha ves aint-eger, ankrad eist, and phil_eth for their input.
