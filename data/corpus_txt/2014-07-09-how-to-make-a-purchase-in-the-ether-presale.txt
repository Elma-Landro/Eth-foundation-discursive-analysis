Titre: Background on the mechanics of the ether pre-sale\nAuteur: Taylor Gerring\nDate: July 9, 2014\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/09/how-to-make-a-purchase-in-the-ether-presale\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nuring the run-up to the ether sale we will be releasing a series of blog posts regarding our development plans and intended organizational structure. oday we describe some of the background details of the ether sale module.  he sale module will be displayed on our website atnnhttps//www.ethereum.orgnnfor the duration of the sale.nnhat is itnnhe ether sale is an /avacript web application that enables people and organizations to pre-purchase ether tokens with bitcoin. ther may be purchased by parties interested in using it in their development of distributed applications on the thereum platform or simply to pay for the use of applications on the platform once the genesis block is released.  he application runs mostly inside the browser, including pseudo random number generation () and encryption/decryption of user secrets.nndditionally, we will be making available a standalone pure ython application that can be used from a command line interface to purchase ether in lieu of using the website store.nnebsite workflownnfter agreeing to the store’s erms and onditions, the buyer enters the desired amount of ether to purchase, their email address, a password to use for encryption, and generates a “random” seed forming the basis for their transaction-specific bitcoin & thereum addresses.nnhennusernnbuyer sends payment in bitcoin to the generated address which is displayed on the store page and also provided in a downloadable encrypted wallet file. hen the browser, which is monitoring the bitcoin blockchain, sees enough funds have been sent to this generated address, the browser creates a new transaction forwarding the bitcoin to the genesis sale address. his transaction is signed by the buyer’s browser and submitted to the bitcoin network. o transaction data is stored onnnthennany servers because the itcoin blockchain serves as the purchase database.nnfter the transaction has been successfully submitted, thennusernnbuyer is again prompted to download a backup copy of their encrypted wallet in addition to being emailed another backup file.  he buyer should be aware that keeping the wallet as an email attachment in an email account for any period of time represents a vulnerability.  he email attachment should be downloaded to a safe computer at the earliest opportunity and the email should be epunged from the email system.nn(hat follows is technical information, the  we have developed abstracts all of this is in a very user-friendly manner)nnallet encryption processnnandomgen a .nn  sha( + “″)]nn  pbkdf()nn  encrypt(, )nn   ,  ] (plus non-sensitive data like ethereum and bitcoin address)nnhe  and  privkeys and addresses are derived from the .nneed recovery processnn +  recovery  (normal)nn  pbkdf()nn  decrypt(, )nnverview of website steps for making an ether purchasennuyer clicks “uy ther” and agrees to the erms & onditionsnnuyer enters initial purchase informationnnuyer enters the amount of ether they’d like to purchasennuyer enters email address as the destination for wallet backup filennuyer enters passphrase, which serves as an encryption seed.  very strong passphrase is highly recommendednnuyer generates entropy by moving their mouse or tapping their screen.  “seed” is constructed based on this generated entropy as well as other random system inputs. hen the desired entropy length is achieved the wallet is generated using the seed.  he wallet containsnnan individual  address to send the funds tonnan individual  addressnnan encrypted seednna backup encrypted seednnhe browser sale app checks the newly created  address to see if funds arrive. efore sending any funds, the buyer has an opportunity to download the wallet. f a problem occurs between transactions, any funds send to the buyer’s personal deposit address will be accessible with the passphrase. f the unspent balance of the  address  . , the browser sale app generates a signed transaction from the newly created  address with  specific outputsnnan output of the total unspent balance minus miners fee to the main sale  address–this btc address is where all the funds go, it’s a fied, known  address.nnan output of  satoshi to a  address generated from the (string)  address–this bitcoin address is for confirming ethereum addresses and is unique for every transaction.nnhe browser sale app prompts the purchaser to download their wallet againnn&nnand also sends the buyer an email containing a backup for the ether wallet.  he same caution as stated above applies.  o not leave the wallet as an email attachment in an email system.  ownload as soon as possible and ensure that the email is epunged.nnhe browser sale app will display the number of bitcoin transaction confirmationsnno that’s it! lthough there’s a lot of technical things happening in the background, the  we have developed will make the process a click by click operation.
