supporting the upgrade were configured using an artificially highnnerminal otal ifficulty ()nn. his ensured that he erge could not be triggered before the opsten eacon hain was ready.nnesterday, at

commands listed above.nnastly, make sure both your eecution and consensus layer clients are fully synced before he erge. his may take up to several days for eecution layer clients.nns an application or tooling developer, what should  donnith he erge going live on opsten, now is the time to ensure that your product works as epected through the proof-of-stake transition and in a post-merge contet. s eplained in annprevious postnn, he erge will have only minimal impact on a subset of contracts deployed on thereum, none of which should be breaking. dditionally, the lion's share of user  endpoints remain stable (unless you use proof-of-work specific methods such asnneth_getorknn).nnhat said, most applications on thereum involve much more than on-chain contracts. ow is the time to ensure that your front-end code, tooling, deployment pipeline and other off-chain components work as intended. e strongly recommend that developers run through a complete testing & deployment cycle on opsten (ornnilnnn) and report any issues with tools or dependencies to those projects' maintainers. f you are unsure where to open an issue, please usennthis repositorynn.nns an thereum user or ther holder, is there anything  need to donno. he thereum mainnet is not affected by this testnet. ubsequent announcements will be made on this blog before mainnet's transition.nns a miner, is there anything  need to donno. f you are mining on the thereum mainnet or opsten, you should be aware that each network will operate entirely under proof-of-stake after he erge. t that point, mining will no longer be possible on the network.nnhis is epected around une -,  on opsten and later this year for the thereum mainnet.nnwen mergenns of the publication of this post, the date for the thereum mainnet proof-of-stake transition hasnnnotnnbeen set. ny source claiming otherwise is likely to be a scam. pdates will be posted on this blog. lease stay safe!nnssuming no issues are found with opsten, once client testing is complete, thereum's other testnets, will run through he erge. nce oerli and epolia have successfully transitioned and stabilized, a slot height will be chosen for the ellatri upgrade on the eacon hain and annterminal total difficulty valuennwill be set for the mainnet transition. lients will then make releases that enable he erge on mainnet. hese will be announced on this blog and in other community publications. he image below illustrates this processnnote that this assumes every step goes as epected. f issues are found at any point in the process or test coverage is judged to be insufficient, these will be addressed before continuing with the deployment process.nnnly then will it be possible to estimate the eact date for he erge.nnn other words, ðŸ”œ.
