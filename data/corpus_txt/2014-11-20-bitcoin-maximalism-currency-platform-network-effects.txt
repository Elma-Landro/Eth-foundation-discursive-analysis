Titre: On Bitcoin Maximalism, and Currency and Platform Network Effects\nAuteur: Vitalik Buterin\nDate: November 20, 2014\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/20/bitcoin-maximalism-currency-platform-network-effects\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nne of the latest ideas that has come to recently achieve some prominence in parts of the itcoin community is the line of thinking that has been described by bothnnmyselfnnandnnothersnnas "itcoin dominance maimalism" or just "itcoin maimalism" for short - essentially, the idea that an environment of multiple competing cryptocurrencies is undesirable, that it is wrong to launch "yet another coin", and that it is both righteous and inevitable that the itcoin currency comes to take a monopoly position in the cryptocurrency scene. ote that this is distinct from a simple desire to support itcoin and make it better such motivations are unquestionably beneficial and  personally continue to contribute to itcoin regularly via my python librarynnpybitcointoolsnn. ather, it is a stance that building something on itcoin is thennonlynncorrect way to do things, and that doing anything else is unethical (seennthis postnnfor a rather hostile eample). itcoin maimalists often use "network effects" as an argument, and claim that it is futile to fight against them. owever, is this ideology actually such a good thing for the cryptocurrency community nd is its core claim, that network effects are a powerful force strongly favoring the eventual dominance of already established currencies, really correct, and even if it is, does that argument actually lead where its adherents think it leadsnnhe echnicalsnnirst, an introduction to the technical strategies at hand. n general, there are three approaches to creating a new crypto protocolnnuild on itcoin the blockchain, but not itcoin the currency (metacoins, eg. most features of ounterparty)nnuild on itcoin the currency, but not itcoin the blockchain (sidechains)nnreate a completely standalone platformnneta-protocols are relatively simple to describe they are protocols that assign a secondary meaning to certain kinds of specially formatted itcoin transactions, and the current state of the meta-protocol can be determined by scanning the blockchain for valid metacoin transactions and sequentially processing the valid ones. he earliest meta-protocol to eist wasnnastercoinnn ounterparty is a newer one. eta-protocols make it much quicker to develop a new protocol, and allow protocols to benefit directly from itcoin's blockchain security, although at a high cost meta-protocols are not compatible with light client protocols, so the only efficient way to use a meta-protocol is via a trusted intermediary.nnidechainsnnare somewhat more complicated. he core underlying idea revolves around a "two-way-pegging" mechanism, where a "parent chain" (usually itcoin) and a "sidechain" share a common currency by making a unit of one convertible into a unit of the other. he way it works is as follows. irst, in order to get a unit of side-coin, a user must send a unit of parent-coin into a special "lockbo script", and then submit a cryptographic proof that this transaction took place into the sidechain. nce this transaction confirms, the user has the side-coin, and can send it at will. hen any user holding a unit of side-coin wants to convert it back into parent-coin, they simply need to destroy the side-coin, and then submit a proof that this transaction took place to a lockbo script on the main chain. he lockbo script would then verify the proof, and if everything checks out it would unlock the parent-coin for the submitter of the side-coin-destroying transaction to spend.nnnfortunately, it is not practical to use the itcoin blockchain and currency at the same time the basic technical reason is that nearly all interesting metacoins involve moving coins under more comple conditions than what the itcoin protocol itself supports, and so a separate "coin" is required (eg.  in astercoin,  in ounterparty). s we will see, each of these approaches has its own benefits, but it also has its own flaws. his point is important particularly, note that many itcoin maimalists' recent glee atnnounterparty forking thereumnnwas misplaced, as ounterparty-based thereum smart contracts cannot manipulate  currency units, and the asset that they are instead likely to promote (and indeed alreadynnhave promotednn) is the .nnetwork ffectsnnow, let us get to the primary argument at play here network effects. n general, network effects can be defined simply a network effect is a property of a system that makes the system intrinsically more valuable the more people use it. or eample, a language has a strong network effect speranto, even if it is technically superior to nglish in the abstract, is less useful in practice because the whole point of a language is to communicate with other people and not many other people speak speranto. n the other hand, a single road has a negative network effect the more people use it the more congested it becomes.nnn order to properly understand what network effects are at play in the cryptoeconomic contet, we need to understand eactly what these network effects are, and eactly what thing each effect is attached to. hus, to start off, let us list a few of the major ones (seennherennandnnherennfor primary sources)nnecurity effectnn systems that are more widely adopted derive their consensus from larger consensus groups, making them more difficult to attack.nnayment system network effectnn payment systems that are accepted by more merchants are more attractive to consumers, and payment systems used by more consumers are more attractive to merchants.nneveloper network effectnn there are more people interested in writing tools that work with platforms that are widely adopted, and the greater number of these tools will make the platform easier to use.nnntegration network effectnn third party platforms will be more willing to integrate with a platform that is widely adopted, and the greater number of these tools will make the platform easier to use.nnize stability effectnn currencies with larger market cap tend to be more stable, and more established cryptocurrencies are seen as more likely (and therefore by self-fulfilling-prophecy actually are more likely) to remain at nonzero value far into the future.nnnit of account network effectnn currencies that are very prominent, and stable, are used as a unit of account for pricing goods and services, and it is cognitively easier to keep track of one's funds in the same unit that prices are measured in.nnarket depth effectnn larger currencies have higher market depth on echanges, allowing users to convert larger quantities of funds in and out of that currency without taking a hit on the market price.nnarket spread effectnn larger currencies have higher liquidity (ie. lower spread) on echanges, allowing users to convert back and forth more efficiently.nnntrapersonal single-currency preference effectnn users that already use a currency for one purpose prefer to use it for other purposes both due to lower cognitive costs and because they can maintain a lower total liquid balance among all cryptocurrencies without paying interchange fees.nnnterpersonal single-currency preference effectnn users prefer to use the same currency that others are using to avoid interchange fees when making ordinary transactionsnnarketing network effectnn things that are used by more people are more prominent and thus more likely to be seen by new users. dditionally, users have more knowledge about more prominent systems and thus are less concerned that they might be eploited by unscrupulous parties selling them something harmful that they do not understand.nnegulatory legitimacy network effectnn regulators are less likely to attack something if it is prominent because they will get more people angry by doing sonnhe first thing that we see is that these network effects are actually rather neatly split up into several categoriesnnblockchain-specific network effectsnn(),nnplatform-specific network effectsnn(-),nncurrency-specific network effectsnn(-), andnngeneral network effectsnn(-), which are to a large etent public goods across the entire cryptocurrency industry. here is a substantial opportunity for confusion here, since itcoin is simultaneously a blockchain, a currency and a platform, but it is important to make a sharp distinction between the three. he best way to delineate the difference is as followsnnnncurrencynnis something which is used as a medium of echange or store of value for eample, dollars,  and .nnnnplatformnnis a set of interoperating tools and infrastructure that can be used to perform certain tasks for currencies, the basic kind of platform is the collection of a payment network and the tools needed to send and receive transactions in that network, but other kinds of platforms may also emerge.nnnnblockchainnnis a consensus-driven distributed database that modifies itself based on the content of valid transactions according to a set of specified rules for eample, the itcoin blockchain, the itecoin blockchain, etc.nno see how currencies and platforms are completely separate, the best eample to use is the world of fiat currencies. redit cards, for eample, are a highly multi-currency platform. omeone with a credit card from anada tied to a bank account using anadian dollars can spend funds at a merchant in witzerland accepting wiss francs, and both sides barely know the difference. eanwhile, even though both are (or at least can be) based on the  dollar, cash and aypal are completely different platforms a merchant accepting only cash will have a hard time with a customer who only has a aypal account.nns for how platforms and blockchains are separate, the best eample is the itcoin payment protocol andnnproof of eistencenn. lthough the two use the same blockchain, they are completely different applications, users of one have no idea how to interpret transactions associated with the other, and it is relatively easy to see how they benefit from completely different network effects so that one can easily catch on without the other. ote that protocols like proof of eistence and actom are mostly eempt from this discussion their purpose is to embed hashes into the most secure available ledger, and while a better ledger has not materialized they should certainly use itcoin, particularly because they can use erkle trees to compress a large number of proofs into a single hash in a single transaction.nnetwork ffects and etacoinsnnow, in this model, let us eamine metacoins and sidechains separately. ith metacoins, the situation is simple metacoins are built on itcoin the blockchain, and not itcoin the platform or itcoin the currency. o see the former, note that users need to download a whole new set of software packages in order to be able to process itcoin transactions. here is a slight cognitive network effect from being able to use the same old infrastructure of itcoin private/public key pairs and addresses, but this is a network effect for the combination of , + and base  and more generally the whole concept of cryptocurrency, not the itcoin platform ogecoin inherits eactly the same gains. o see the latter, note that, as mentioned above, ounterparty has its own internal currency, the . ence, metacoins benefit from the network effect of itcoin's blockchain security, but do not automatically inherit all of the platform-specific and currency-specific network effects.nnf course, metacoins' departure from the itcoin platform and itcoin currency is not absolute. irst of all, even though ounterparty is not "on" the itcoin platform, it can in a very meaningful sense be said to be "close" to the itcoin platform - one can echange back and forth between  and  very cheaply and efficiently. ross-chain centralized or decentralized echange, while possible, is several times slower and more costly. econd, some features of ounterparty, particularly the token sale functionality, do not rely on moving currency units under any conditions that the itcoin protocol does not support, and so one can use that functionality without ever purchasing , using  directly. inally, transaction fees in all metacoins can be paid in , so in the case ofnnpurely non-financial applicationsnnmetacoins actually do fully benefit from itcoin's currency effect, although we should note that in most non-financial cases developers are used to messaging being free, so convincing anyone to use a non-financial blockchain dapp at $. per transaction will likely be an uphill battle.nnn some of these applications - particularly, perhaps to itcoin maimalists' chagrin, ounterparty's crypto . token sales, the desire to move back and forth quickly to and from itcoin, as well as the ability to use it directly, may indeed create a platform network effect that overcomes the loss of secure light client capability and potential for blockchain speed and scalability upgrades, and it is in these cases that metacoins may find their market niche. owever, metacoins are most certainly not an all-purpose solution it is absurd to believe that itcoin full nodes will have the computational ability to process every single crypto transaction that anyone will ever want to do, and so eventually movement to eithernnscalable architecturesnnornnmultichain environmentsnnwill be necessary.nnetwork ffects and idechainsnnidechains have the opposite properties of metacoins. hey are built on itcoin the currency, and thus benefit from itcoin's currency network effects, but they are otherwise eactly identical to fully independent chains and have the same properties. his has several pros and cons. n the positive side, it means that, although "sidechains" by themselves are not a scalability solution as they do not solve the security problem, future advancements in multichain, sharding or other scalability strategies are all open to them to adopt.nnn the negative side, however, they do not benefit from itcoin's platform network effects. ne must download special software in order to be able to interact with a sidechain, and one must eplicitly move one's bitcoins onto a sidechain in order to be able to use it - a process wich is equally as difficult as converting them into a new currency in a new network via a decentralized echange. n fact, lockstream employees have themselves admitted that the process for converting side-coins back into bitcoins is relatively inefficient, to the point that most people seeking to move their bitcoins there and back will in fact usenneactly the samenncentralized or decentralized echange processes as would be used to migrate to a different currency on an independent blockchain.nndditionally, note that there is one security approach that independent networks can use which is not open to sidechainsnnproof of stakenn. he reasons for this are twofold. irst one of the key arguments in favor of proof of stake is that even a successful attack against proof of stake will be costly for the attacker, as the attacker will need to keep his currency units deposited and watch their value drop drastically as the market realizes that the coin is compromised. his incentive effect does not eist if the only currency inside of a network is pegged to an eternal asset whose value is not so closely tied to that network's success.nnecond, proof of stake gains much of its security because the process of buying up % of a coin in order to mount a takeover attack will itself increase the coin's price drastically, making the attack even more epensive for the attacker. n a proof of stake sidechain, however, one can easily move a very large quantity of coins into a chain from the parent chain, an mount the attack without moving the asset price at all. ote that both of these arguments continue to apply even if itcoin itself upgrades to proof of stake for its security. ence, if you believe that proof of stake is the future, then both metacoins and sidechains (or at leastnnpurennsidechains) become highly suspect, and thus for that purely technical reason itcoin maimalism (or, for that matter, ether maimalism, or any other kind of currency maimalism) becomes dead in the water.nnurrency etwork ffects, evisitednnltogether, the conclusion from the above two points is twofold. irst, there is nonnuniversal and scalablennapproach that allows users to benefit from itcoin's platform network effects. ny software solution that makes it easy for itcoin users to move their funds to sidechains can be easily converted into a solution that makes it just as easy for itcoin users to convert their funds into an independent currency on an independent chain. n the other hand, however, currency network effects are another story, and may indeed prove to be a genuine advantage for itcoin-based sidechains over fully independent networks. o, what eactly are these effects and how powerful is each one in this contet et us go through them againnnize-stability network effectnn(larger currencies are more stable) - this network effect is legitimate, and itcoin has been shown to be less volatile than smaller coins.nnnit of account network effectnn(very large currencies become units of account, leading to more purchasing power stability via price stickiness as well as higher salience) - unfortunately, itcoin will likely never be stable enough to trigger this effect the best empirical evidence we can see for this is likely thennvaluation history of goldnn.nnarket depth effectnn(larger currencies support larger transactions without slippage and have a lower bid/ask spread) - these effect are legitimate up to a point, but then beyond that point (perhaps a market cap of $-$), the market depth is imply good enough and the spread is low enough for nearly all types of transactions, and the benefit from further gains is small.nningle-currency preference effectnn(people prefer to deal with fewer currencies, and prefer to use the same currencies that others are using) - the intrapersonal and interpersonal parts to this effect are legitimate, but we note that (i) the intrapersonal effect only applies within individual people, not between people, so it does not prevent an ecosystem with multiple preferrednnglobalnncurrencies from eisting, and (ii) the interpersonal effect is small as interchange fees especially in crypto tend to be very low, less than .%, and will likely go down to essentially zero with decentralized echange.nnence, the single-currency preference effect is likely the largest concern, followed by the size stability effects, whereas the market depth effects are likely relatively tiny once a cryptocurrency gets to a substantial size. owever, it is important to note that the above points have several major caveats. irst, if () and () dominate, then we know ofnneplicit strategiesnnfor making a new coin that is even more stable than itcoin even at a smaller size thus, they are certainly not points in itcoin's favor.nnecond, those same strategies (particularly the eogenous ones) can actually be used to create a stable coin that is pegged to a currency that has vastly larger network effects than even itcoin itself namely, the  dollar. he  dollar is thousands of times larger than itcoin, people are already used to thinking in terms of it, and most importantly of all it actually maintains its purchasing power at a reasonable rate in the short to medium term without massive volatility. mployees of lockstream, the company behind sidechains, have often promoted sidechains under the slogan "nninnovation without speculationnn" however, the slogan ignores that itcoin itself is quite speculative and as we see from the eperience of gold always will be, so seeking to install itcoin as thennonlynncryptoasset essentially forces all users of cryptoeconomic protocols to participate in speculation. ant true innovation without speculation hen perhaps we should all engage in a little  dollar stablecoin maimalism instead.nninally, in the case of transaction fees specifically, the intrapersonal single-currency preference effect arguably disappears completely. he reason is that the quantities involved are so small ($.-$. per transaction) that a dapp can simply siphon off $ from a user's itcoin wallet at a time as needed, not even telling the user that other currencies eist, thereby lowering the cognitive cost of managing even thousands of currencies to zero. he fact that this token echange is completely non-urgent also means that the client can even serve as a market maket while moving coins from one chain to the other, perhaps even earning a profit on the currency interchange bid/ask spread. urthermore, because the user does not see gains and losses, and the user's average balance is so low that thenncentral limit theoremnnguarantees with overwhelming probability that the spikes and drops will mostly cancel each other out, stability is also fairly irrelevant. ence, we can make the point that alternative tokens which are meant to serve primarily as "cryptofuels"nndo not suffer from currency-specific network effect deficiencies at allnn. et a thousand cryptofuels bloom.nnncentive and sychological rgumentsnnhere is another class of argument, one which may perhaps be called a network effect but not completely, for why a service that uses itcoin as a currency will perform better the incentivized marketing of the itcoin community. he argument goes as follows. ervices and platforms based on itcoin the currency (and to a slight etent services based on itcoin the platform) increase the value of itcoin. ence, itcoin holders would personally benefit from the value of their  going up if the service gets adopted, and are thus motivated to support it.nnhis effect occurs on two levels the individual and the corporate. he corporate effect is a simple matter of incentives large businesses will actually support or even create itcoin-based dapps to increase itcoin's value, simply because they are so large that even the portion of the benefit that personally accrues to themselves is enough to offset the costs this is the "nnspeculative philanthropynn" strategy described by aniel rawisz.nnhe individual effect is not so much directly incentive-based each individual's ability to affect itcoin's value is tiny. ather, it's more a clever eploitation of psychological biases. t's well-known thatnnpeople tend to change their moral valuesnnto align with their personal interests, so the channel here is more comple people who hold  start to see it as being in the common interest for itcoin to succeed, and so they will genuinely and ecitedly support such applications. s it turns out, even a small amount of incentive suffices to shift over people's moral values to such a large etent, creating a psychological mechanism that manages to overcome not just the coordination problem but also, to a weak etent, the public goods problem.nnhere are several major counterarguments to this claim. irst, it is not at all clear that the total effect of the incentive and psychological mechanisms actually increases as the currency gets larger. lthough a larger size leads to more people affected by the incentive, a smaller size creates a more concentrated incentive, as people actually have the opportunity to make a substantial difference to the success of the project. he tribal psychology behind incentive-driven moral adjustment may well be stronger for small "tribes" where individuals also have strong social connections to each other than larger tribes where such connections are more diffuse this is somewhat similar to thennemeinschaft vs esellschaftnndistinction in sociology. erhaps a new protocol needs to have a concentrated set of highly incentivized stakeholders in order to seed a community, and itcoin maimalists are wrong to try to knock this ladder down after itcoin has so beautifully and successfully climbed up it. n any case, all of the research aroundnnoptimum currency areasnnwill have to be heavily redone in the contet of the newer volatile cryptocurrencies, and the results may well go down either way.nnecond, the ability for a network to issue units of a new coin has been proven to be a highly effective and successful mechanism for solving the public goods problem of funding protocol development, and any platform that does not somehow take advantage of the seignorage revenue from creating a new coin is at a substantial disadvantage. o far, the only major crypto . protocol-building company that has successfully funded itself without some kind of "pre-mine" or "pre-sale" is lockstream (the company behind sidechains), which recently received $ million of venture capital funding from ilicon alley investors. iven lockstream's self-inflicted inability to monetize via tokens, we are left with three viable eplanations for how investors justified the fundingnnhe funding was essentially an act of speculative philathropy on the part of ilicon alley venture capitalists looking to increase the value of their  and their other -related investments.nnlockstream intends to earn revenue by taking a cut of the fees from their blockchains (non-viable because the public will almost certainly reject such a clear and blatant centralized siphoning of resources even more virulently then they would reject a new currency)nnlockstream intends to "sell services", ie. follow the edat model (viable for them but few others note that the total room in the market for edat-style companies is quite small)nnoth () and () are highly problematic () because it means that few other companies will be able to follow its trail and because it gives them the incentive to cripple their protocols so they can provide centralized overlays, and () because it means that crypto . companies must all follow the model of sucking up to the particular concentrated wealthy elite in ilicon alley (or maybe an alternative concentrated wealthy elite in hina), hardly a healthy dynamic for a decentralized ecosystem that prides itself on its high degree of political independence and its disruptive nature.nnronically enough, the only "independent" sidechain project that has so far announced itself,nnruthcoinnn, has actually managed to get the best of both worlds the project got on the good side of the itcoin maimalist bandwagon by announcing that it will be a sidechain, but in fact the development team intends to introduce into the platform two "coins" - one of which will be a  sidechain token and the other an independent currency that is meant to be, that's right, crowd-sold.nn ew trategynnhus, we see that while currency network effects are sometimes moderately strong, and they will indeed eert a preference pressure in favor of itcoin over other eisting cryptocurrencies, the creation of an ecosystem that uses itcoin eclusively is a highly suspect endeavor, and one that will lead to a total reduction and increased centralization of funding (as only the ultra-rich have sufficient concentrated incentive to be speculative philanthropists), closed doors in security (no more proof of stake), and is not even necessarily guaranteed to end with itcoin willing. o is there an alternative strategy that we can take re there ways to get the best of both worlds, simultaneously currency network effects and securing the benefits of new protocols launching their own coinsnns it turns out, there is the dual-currency model. he dual-currency model, arguablynnpioneered by obert amsnn, although in various incarnations independently discovered bynnitsharesnn, ruthcoin andnnmyselfnn, is at the core simple every network will contain two (or even more) currencies, splitting up the role of medium of transaction and vehicle of speculation and stake (the latter two roles are best merged, because as mentioned above proof of stake works best when participants suffer the most from a fork). he transactional currency will be either a itcoin sidechain, as in ruthcoin's model, or an endogenousnnstablecoinnn, or an eogenous stablecoin that benefits from the almighty currency network effect of the  dollar (or uro or  or  or whatever else). ayekian currency competition will determine which kind of itcoin, altcoin or stablecoin users prefer perhaps sidechain technology can even be used to make one particular stablecoin transferable across many networks.nnhe vol-coin will be the unit of measurement of consensus, and vol-coins will sometimes be absorbed to issue new stablecoins when stablecoins are consumed to pay transaction fees hence, as eplainted in the argument in the linked article on stablecoins, vol-coins can be valued as a percentage of future transaction fees. ol-coins can be crowd-sold, maintaining the benefits of a crowd sale as a funding mechanism. f we decide that eplicit pre-mines or pre-sales are "unfair", or that they have bad incentives because the developers' gain is frontloaded, then we can instead use voting (as in ) ornnprediction marketsnninstead to distribute coins to developers in a decentralized way over time.nnnother point to keep in mind is, what happens to the vol-coins themselves echnological innovation is rapid, and if each network gets unseated within a few years, then the vol-coins may well never see substantial market cap. ne answer is to solve the problem by using a clever combination of atoshian thinking and good old-fashionednnrecursive punishment systemsnnfrom the offline world establish a social norm that every new coin should pre-allocate -% of its units to some reasonable subset of the coins that came before it that directly inspired its creation, and enforce the norm blockchain-style - if your coin does not honor its ancestors, then its descendants will refuse to honor it, instead sharing the etra revenues between the originally cheated ancestors and themselves, and no one will fault them for that. his would allow vol-coins to maintain continuity over the generations. itcoin itself can be included among the list of ancestors for any new coin. erhaps an industry-wide agreement of this sort is what is needed to promote the kind of cooperative and friendly evolutionary competition that is required for a multichain cryptoeconomy to be truly successful.nnould we have used a vol-coin/stable-coin model for thereum had such strategies been well-known si months ago uite possibly yes unfortunately it's too late to make the decision now at the protocol level, particularly since the ether genesis block distribution and supply model is essentially finalized. ortunately, however, thereum allows users to create their own currencies inside of contracts, so it is entirely possible that such a system can simply be grafted on, albeit slightly unnaturally, over time. ven without such a change, ether itself will retain a strong and steady value as a cryptofuel, and as a store of value for thereum-based security deposits, simply because of the combination of the thereum blockchain's network effect (which actually is a platform network effect, as all contracts on the thereum blockchain have a common interface and can trivially talk to each other) and the weak-currency-network-effect argument described for cryptofuels above preserves for it a stable position. or . multichain interaction, however, and for future platforms like ruthcoin, the decision of which new coin model to take is all too relevant.
