Titre: Jeff’s Ethereum ÐΞV Update I\nAuteur: Jeffrey Wilcke\nDate: November 2, 2014\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/02/jeffs-ethereum-dev-update\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nthought it was about time 'd give an update on my side of things for those interested in knowing how we're doing on the utch side. y name is eff, a founder of thereum and one of the three directors (alongside italik and avin) of thereumnnÐΞnn, the development entity building thereum and all the associated tech.nnver the past months 've been been looking for a suitable office space to host the msterdam ub. nfortunately it takes more work than  initially anticipated and have got nothing to show for so far. 've past on this tasks to my good friend and now colleague aran. aran will do all he can to find the best suitable place for the ms hub and the development of ist. hose who are using the thereum rogramming languagennmutannnyou may want to switch over to erpent or the soon to be de-facto programming languagennoliditynn. 've made the sensible decision to focus my attention on to more pressing matters such as the development of the protocol and the browser. erhaps in the future 'll have time to pick up it's development again.nnÐΞ msterdamnnhe lawyers have finally, after  months, gotten around to set up the company here in msterdam (ugh, the utch and their bureaucracy eh) and we've found a bank that is willing to accept us as their loyal customers (...). t the moment we have a few options for our office space and 'll write about them as soon as  know something more concrete.nnhe eamnnt's about time the ms team got a proper introduction. hese guys do some serious good work!nnhe first that joined the ms team isnnle van de andenn(akannavsann). le is a gifted  engineer and he's been with us for quite a while. t was only a matter of time before he became an official member of the ÐΞ team. le has taken up the task of  development and  epert and is prototyping the latest of the eb browser.nnhe second that joined the team isnniktor rónnn. ik is a crazy math-head and is currently hacking away at the new  and testing it rigourously. 've known ik all the way back since the start of the project somewhere in an/eb, he's a great guy and a real asset to this team.nnhe third that joined the team isnneli angenn. eli is a die-hard opher (yay!) and the first thing he pointed out to me was that  had done a bad job looking after my go routines and there were a lot of race conditions, so nice of him (- eli is going to work on the hisper implementation once the spec has been formally finalised. eli is a super star gopher and has the ability to become a true thereum ore ev.nnhe fourth that joined the team is aniel agy. aniel has a history in crypto and security and his first tasks is to create a comprehensive spec for our  implementation and the development thereof.nnast but certainly not least isnnaran idskesnn. aran has been on this team before but in a completely different role. aran used to work on the protocol but after spawning anncrying, -peeing, -pooping machinennnew member of his family he decided to take some time off. ow his main role is to look after the daunting task the administration of ÐΞ msterdam.nnven though they are not on anyone's team,  like to thank ick, aktu and oris for their ongoing effort in developing out ournnbuild systemsnn. 'd also like to thank ick specifically for pointing out the inconsistencies between our implementationsnnick, you truly are a great pain in my ass (-nnnwardsnnhile we are marching towards the net instalment in the roof of oncept (o-) we still have got quite some work ahead of us.nnecently 've started to build a toolset so we may test out hristoph (he's on the erlin team) awesome tests suit. hristoph has put a tremendous amount of work in developing out a proper testing suit for the thereum protocol.  never knew people could enjoy writing tests like you do, you've got my uttermost most respect.nn've also started a cross-implementation avacript framework callednnethereum.jsnn. thereum.js is quickly gaining adoption from the rest of the ther ackers and is already in use by the o websocket &   implementation, ++   implementation and the ode.js implementation. thereum.js is a true ÐΞ cross implementation team effort.nnur olish partners at  (aweł and rtur) have completed their first implementation of the -compiled -based  implementation and have agreed to create a o bridge so that ist may benefit from the speed increase in running thereum contracts mentioned earlier innnav's updatenn.nninally, the  and  refinement of ist, our flagship consumer product and net-generation browser, continues at great pace. n early 'preview' of the ist interface can be downloadednnherenn. t's going to be impossible to deliver that type of behemoth of a browser for the first version but it will certainly be the end-goal.nninnn shall try to keep up writing blog post with updates regarding ist, the protocol and ÐΞ in general so stay tuned!nneff (jeffrey.spammenot.wilckeethdev.com)
