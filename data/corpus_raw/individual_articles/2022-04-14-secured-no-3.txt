Titre: Secured #3: Security Teams\nAuteur: Security Research Team\nDate: April 14, 2022\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/04/14/secured-no-3\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nver the past year, the thereum oundation has significantly grown its team of dedicated security researchers and engineers. embers have joined from a variety of backgrounds ranging from cryptography, security architecture, risk management, eploit development as well as having worked on red and blue teams. he members come from different fields and have worked on securing everything from the internet services we all depend on each day, to national healthcare systems and central banks.nns he erge approaches, a lot of effort from the team is spent analyzing, auditing and researching the onsensus ayer in various ways as well as he erge itself.  sample of the work is found below.nnlient mplementation udits 🛡️nneam members audit the various client implementations with a variety of tools and techniques.nnutomated cans 🤖nnutomated scans for codebases aim to catch low hanging fruit such as dependency vulnerabilities (and potential vulnerabilities) or improvement areas in code. ome of the tools being used for static analysis are ode, semgrep, rrorrone and osy.nns there are many different languages used between the clients, we use both generic and language specific scanners for the codebases and images. hese are interconnected through a system that analyzes and reports new findings from all tools into relevant channels. hese automated scans make it possible to quickly get reports about issues that potential adversaries are likely to easily find, thus increasing the chance of fiing issues before they can be eploited.nnanual udits 🔨nnanual audits of components of the stack are also an important technique. hese efforts include auditing critical shared dependencies (), libpp, new functionality in hardforks (eg. sync committees in ltair), a thorough audit into a specific client implementation, or auditing s and bridges.nndditionally, when vulnerabilities are reported via thennthereum ug ounty rogramnn, researchers can cross-check issues against all clients to see if they are also affected by the reported issue.nnhird arty udits 🧑‍🔧nnt times, third party firms are engaged to audit various components. hird party audits are used to get eternal eyes on new clients, updated protocol specifications, upcoming network upgrades, or anything else deemed high-value.nnuring third party audits, software developers and our team's security researchers collaborate with the auditors to educate and assist throughout.nnuzzing 🦾nnhere are many ongoing fuzzing efforts led by our security researchers, members of client teams, as well as contributors in the ecosystem. he majority of tooling is open source and runs on dedicated infrastructure. he fuzzers target critical attack surfaces such as  handlers, state transition and fork-choice implementations, etc. dditional efforts include osy eighbor ( based auto fuzz harness generation) which is  based and built off of the o arser library.nnetwork level simulation and testing 🕸️nnur team's security researchers build and utilize tools to simulate, test, and attack controlled network environmets. hese tools can quickly spin up local and eternal testnets ("attacknets") running under various configurations to test eotic scenarios that clients must be hardened against (eg. , peer segregation, network degradation).nnttacknets provide an efficient and safe environment to quickly test different ideas/attacks in a private setting. rivate attacknets cannot be monitored by potential adversaries and allow us to break things without disrupting the user eperience of public testnets. n these environments, we regularly utilize disruptive techniques such as thread pausing and network partitioning to further epand the scenarios.nnlient and nfrastucture iversity esearch 🔬nnlient and infrastructure diversitynnhas received a lot of attention from the community. e have tools in place to monitor the diversity from a client, ,  and crawler statistics. dditionally we analyze network participation rates, attestation timing anomalies and general network health. his information isnnsharednnacrossnnmultiplennlocations to highlight any potential risks.nnug ounty rogram 🐛nnhe  currently hosts two bug bounty programs one targeting thennecution ayernnand another targeting thennonsensus ayernn. embers of the security team monitor incoming reports, work to verify their accuracy and impact, and then cross-check any issues against other clients. ecently, we published a disclosure of allnnpreviously reported vulnerabilitiesnn.nnoon, these two programs will be merged into one, the general platform will be improved, and additional rewards will be provided for bounty hunters. tay tuned for more information on this soon!nnperational ecurity 🔒nnperational ecurity encompasses many efforts at the . or eample, asset monitoring has been setup which continually monitor infrastructure and domains for known vulnerabilities.nnthereum etwork onitoring 🩺nn new thereum network monitoring system is being developed. his system works similar to annnnand is built to listen to and monitor the thereum network for pre-configured detection rules as well as dynamic anomaly detection that scans for outlier events. nce in place, this system will provide early warnings about network disruptions in progress or coming up.nnhreat nalysis 🩻nnur team conducted a threat analysis focuse on he erge to identify areas that can improved with respect to security. ithin this work, we collected and audited security practices for ode eviews, nfrastructure ecurity, eveloper ecurity, uild ecurity (,  and  built into , etc.), epository ecurity, and more from the client teams. dditionally this analysis surveyed how to prevent misinformation, from which disasters may strike, and how the community might recover in various scenrios. ome efforts related to disaster recovery eercises are also of interest.nnthereum lient ecurity roup 🤝nns he erge approaches, we formed a security group that consists of members of client teams working on both the ecution ayer and the onsensus ayer. his group will meet regularly to discuss matters related to security such as vulnerabilities, incidents, best practices, on-going security work, suggestions, etc.nnncident esponse 🚒nnlue eam efforts help bridge the gap between the ecution ayer and the onsensus ayer as he erge moves closer. ar rooms for incident response has worked well in the past where chats would spring up with relevant people during incidents, but with he erge comes new compleity. urther work is being done to (for eample) share tooling, create additional debug and triage capabilities and create documentation.nnhank you and get involved 💪nnhese are some of the efforts currently taking place in various forms, and we're looking forward to share even more with you in the future!nnf you think you’ve found a security vulnerability or any bug, please submit a bug report to thenneecution layernnornnconsensus layernnbug bounty programs! 💜🦄
