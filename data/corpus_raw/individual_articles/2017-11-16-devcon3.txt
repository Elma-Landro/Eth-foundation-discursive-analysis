Titre: Devcon3!!!\nAuteur: Ming Chan\nDate: November 16, 2017\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/11/16/devcon3\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nnote from the nn big thanks to our attending dev community, presenters, internal team, sponsors, enthusiasts, volunteers, event team, students and other stakeholders for coming together for another phenomenal evcon!nnirst of all, yes, video of all sessions, both from the ain all and reakout all will be posted on the thereum oundation ouube channel as soon as our post production team can finish them. his year  contracted and brought a post production team to the venue with us so they could start work onsite as soon as the raw footage could be handed over. ince we had two halls instead of one, the number of presentations to process was close to double, so the guys are working hard to cut, edit, render and upload four days (versus three days from last year) of devcon presentations to the web.nnhere will be a tweet (ethereumproject) in the net - days!nnecondly, as promised, we spent the requisite time and resources to engage vendors who could deliver free live streaming of the main stage presentations so that people who couldn’t be at the venue could see the ain all presentations in real time. y all accounts, live streaming went well for those who had a conducive internet connection.nnhirdly, the photos taken by the official evcon photographers are ready! hey are now being prepared in albums to be shared online early net week.nns ecutive irector of the thereum oundation, one of my responsibilities is running evcon, and it is with pleasure that  am able to plan and eecute our annual developers conference, including enjoying being an emcee for the event, which allows me to engage more with our development community than any other time during the year.nnt was a tall order to meet the high epectations our attending community had for evcon, which is why planning began - months ago. hen we finally opened the event, everyone felt the time, effort and work to plan such an event was worth it.nn personally returned to ancun a number of times to scale the event up four times in response to popular demand and to accommodate as much of the overflow as possible. appily, we were able to safely and effectively increase capacity and ancun ended up being the most popular location we’ve had to date. fter the multiple capacity increases for evcon, the number of people we were able to safely accommodate in the end was close to .nnt was not without substantive effort from all our event teams to provide an event with . times the attendees as last year while increasing the physical space from one ballroom to making use of conference center in which we utilized three floors at any given time, and occupied over , square feet of rooms, open areas, auditoriums and halls.nnor the first time, evcon provided a second presentation hall, enabling % more sessions a press room with a live feed of the main stage presentations various meeting rooms and open spaces for networking larger customized sponsor “booths” presenter work areas devcon and internal team work rooms and two scheduled breakout sessions (one on the subject of zk-s research with li en assoon as special guest speaker, and a breakout session on  technologies organized by our warm team).nnriginally, locations in  cities were considered, but a substantive number of emails to the oundation asked we do not hold evcon in the  due to inability to acquire visas. he current less than welcoming immigration policies and long delays travelers have eperienced just in transferring planes or laying over in the  was also not conducive. opefully the situation will improve in the future.nnevertheless, ’m pleased to say that not only was our evcon venue devoid of security incidents, many attendees have shared photos and stories of their meetups, ecursions and enjoyment of the world-class beaches, trips to ayan ruins, and time in the sun and warm blue waters of aribbean outside of the venue. he ancun hotel zone was the best location to provide the needed services in the area, including lodging, capacity, internet access and amenities to hold a conference like evcon. ince evcon is epected to increase in size by some margin, venues will likely remain in developed and/or more urban areas.nnhough ’ve been in the crypto space since , it wasn’t until  ran evcon that  realized why the thereum community was so unique and valuable to the greater blockchain ecosystem. t became clear that the oundation’s & focused program would best serve developers with a curated &-centric program to enable developers to come together in realtime, face-to-face at least once a year.nnhe evcon eperience naturally embodies a kind of cohesiveness in spite of a realm that typically communicates virtually/remotely and asynchronously.nnn any case, the energy and ecitement at evcon is not quite tangible unless one is physically present. or those people who were unable to attend, this year we provided segregated bandwidth for live streaming.nns an aside, we were informed by last year’s venue that reliable live streaming was not available in hina for any amount of money, but that is part of cost of having an event in certain countries, which in our estimation was still well worth it, especially as last year was an important one to support the interest, growth and momentum coming from the growing hinese community.nnhere are now many events in the thereum, crypto and blockchain space and even more appearing to serve various sectors and special interest groups including events for enterprise, insurance, banking, fintech, financial services, investors/s, the energy sector, government, education and related hackathons, pitch-offs, etc. s thereum moves towards greater adoption, it becomes even more valuable for the oundation’s developers conference (evcon) to stay true to one that addresses platform, base layer development and research.nnhe work our developers and others do at the platform development and research level is critical to informing the work done by applications developers, business people, eecutives supporting and innovating in emergent tech, as well as inventors, technology systems designers, and other progressive thinkers incorporating or using the thereum platform in their businesses and organizations.nnur & projects have grown steadily from about si areas of development two years ago, to around twenty efforts and sub-projects today. ee the periodic roundup summaries on the thereum blog for reference.nnt’s no secret the demand for thereum developers far eceeds the supply. or this reason, we deliberately set aside a percentage of passes this year to provide to students, professors, researchers and university people, who tend not to have the resources or time to easily attend events like evcon, but are an important factor in supporting a healthy pipeline for developers while contributing to academic research, thought and investigation, all of which benefits the community and ecosystem at large. ’m pleased to say evcon had the biggest and most international showing of students and university people to date.nnf course there is always room for improvement and the best event can be even better. et year we are looking into using  passes used by events like omicon to improve registration, and we will likely increase the capacity of the second hall and possibly add additional “tracks”. he location is determined by a number of logistical factors, and while we welcome input like last year, since our community is an international one, no single location comes to the forefront.nnevcon has come a long way in the last three years. evcon was an internal developer gathering in erlin with about fifty people. evcon was held in a ballroom in ondon with a capacity of  people, though closer to  people attended. evcon was in a grand ballroom at a hotel in hanghai with a capacity of  people, topping out at closer to  participants. e were  participants strong this year!nno reduce the carbon footprint of such a large event, and to support the local economy, we sourced everything locally from printing, manufacturing, and production of items for the event, and gave preference to locals for volunteer opportunities. ost if not all of the eican residents and panish speaking volunteers from neighboring countries would not have been able to participate if their only option was to pay for a  or uropean-priced event. he average monthly income in the ucatan eninsula is about how much the cost of deeply discounted student pass would be.nnevcon volunteers were students, community developers and organizers, researchers, or thereum enthusiasts who went through a review and approval and interview process to join the event team. t is with their help, the cooperation of our attending community and our internal teams that we were able to together bring about yet another great outcome.nnn spite of how difficult, uniquely epressive and dramatic the world of crypto can be, evcon as a non-profit developers conference has been a special event that amplifies the best our community and organization has to offer.nncknowlegementsnnany thanks goes out to all the teams and individuals involved in this year’s planning and eecution in no particular order  and eternal relations, graphic design and art direction webdev, /, photography and post production team members oundation directors, legal team, eecutive and administrative assistants program and agenda team members local eican and panish speaking volunteers who helped with translation, communications with eican vendors, and volunteers working with press, performing emcee duties, helping with internal security and handling tshirt and registration and our eican venue and vendor team leads and main contacts.nnf course thanks to all our team leads, researchers and developers for presenting on their projects and sharing their work, thoughts and time at evcon and helping to coordinate their teams for panels and group presentations. lso, a big thanks goes to all the presenters in the agenda who provided information, insight, eplanation and elucidation on their thereum research, development work, projects and efforts. pecial thanks goes to oya who spent by far the most amount of time assisting me with overall evcon planning and eecution.nn’d also like thank all the evcon top tier sponsors who went through a fairly involved process to participate in and support the event, as well as our community sponsors. or a second year, our program to involve small companies and startups was popular to the point of being oversubscribed months before the event. f we continue offering sponsorships net year, we will adjust the number of spots for community sponsors upwards to enable more startups and young companies with limited resources to participate.nninally and most importantly, it is the attending community interested in thereum development and research who not only represent the bulk of participants at evcon, but are part and parcel of the positive, constructive and high energy that evcon brings together. ur event greatly serves this community of people, which has been growing, evolving and gathering more momentum as the years go by (all three of them)!nn“ith love from ancun”nnhe  (ecutive oge)nning han
