Titre: Announcing the Kintsugi Merge Testnet\nAuteur: Tim Beiko\nDate: December 20, 2021\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/20/kintsugi-merge-testnet\nCat√©gorie: Non cat√©goris√©\n\n==================================================\n\nince returning from thennmphora merge workshopnn, client teams have been hard at work implementing the latest versions of merge specifications and testing them on devnets.nnfter four ephemeral devnets, intsugi üçµ, annlonger-lived public testnetnn, is now live!nnlthough client development and  continue to be refined, we encourage the community to start using intsugi to familiarize themselves with thereum in a post-merge contet. or application developers,nnas previously eplainednn, not much will change. ooling which only interacts with either the consensus or eecution layer is also largely unaffected. nfrastructure which depends on both layers is most likely to need to adapt to support he erge.nne recommend most projects begin testing and prototyping on intsugi to surface any potential issues soon. his way, changes can more easily be incorporated in future client and specification versions.nnsing intsuginnheck out thennintsugi landing pagennfor information about interacting with the intsugi network. ou'll find network settings, a faucet, a block eplorer and a - endpoint, along with documentation updated to reflect supported consensus  eecution layer client combinations.nns a reminder, post-merge, a full thereum client is comprised of both a eacon / onsensus node and an ecution engine (handled by an eisting "th" client). oth layers maintain independent  endpoints and peer connections to handle their respective role. or a full overview of thereum's post-merge architecture, seennthis postnn.nnupport & eedbacknnhe thtaker community is available to provide intsugi support. f you have questions, encounter errors or need clarifications, they are happy to provide assistance in thenn#testingthemergeüêºnnchannel of theirnniscord servernn.nnith the launch of intsugi, we hope the community gets involved #estingheerge. heck ou this list ofnntest scenariosnnfor ideas on how to bring your testing to the net level.nnf you identify bugs or issues with the specification, the best place to raise these is in thenn#merge-generalnnchannel of thennthereum & iscord servernn. f you'd rather not use iscord, other venues to raise such issues are the specification repositories (nnconsensusnn,nneecutionnn,nnsnn), andnnthereum agiciansnn‚ú®.nnet tepsnnhe intsugi testnet provides the community an opportunity to eperiment with post-merge thereum and begin to identify any issues. nce feedback has been incorporated into the client sofware and the specifications, a final series of testnets will be launched. n parallel, testing efforts will continue ramping up.nnfter this, eisting long-lived testnets will run through he erge. nce these have upgraded and are stable, net up is thereum mainnet's transition to proof of stake üéä.nnor those eager to follow the progress at a more granular level, annmainnet readiness checklistnnis publicly available and regularly updated.nnee you on intsugi üçµ!
