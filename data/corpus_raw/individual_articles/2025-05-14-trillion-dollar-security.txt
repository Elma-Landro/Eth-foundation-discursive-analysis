Titre: Announcing the Trillion Dollar Security Initiative\nAuteur: Ethereum Foundation Team\nDate: Team on May 14, 2025\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/05/14/trillion-dollar-security\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nthereum is the most secure blockchain ecosystem. his is the result of  years of progress and iteration across every level of thereum’s technology stack, from wallet  to developer tooling to consensus protocol security.nnut being the most secure platform in the crypto ecosystem isn’t enough. thereum’s ambition is far greater to be civilization-scale infrastructure that securely underpins the internet and global economy, surpassing the safety and trustworthiness of the world’s legacy systems.nnoday we are announcing thennrillion ollar ecuritynninitiative, an ecosystem-wide effort to upgrade thereum’s security to help bring the world onchain.nneaching “rillion ollar security” means a world wherennillions of individuals are each comfortable storing more than $ onchain, collectively amounting to trillions of dollars secured on thereum.nnompanies, institutions or governments are comfortable storing more than  trillion dollars of value inside a single contract or application.nnhat will the  project donnhis initiative has three componentsnn() appingnnthe landscape of security strengths and attack vectors across every domain and layer of thereum’s technology stack. e will gather input from across the ecosystem and synthesize this into a security overview report that will help us identify focus areas.nnhis mapping will span a wide range of domains, including  (blind signing, frontend security), wallet security (firmware issues, supply chain attacks), smart contract security (developer tooling, standard libraries), infrastructure (cloud security, dependency management), consensus and protocol security ( risks, stake centralization), internet infra ( level censorship), and more.nn() ecutingnnon improvements in focus areas identified during the mapping overview. e will work closely with the ecosystem to implement near-term high priority fies and allocate investments for longer term improvement projects.nn() ommunicatingnnmore effectively about thereum’s security. sers of all kinds should be able to understand, utilize, and benefit from thereum’s strong security foundation. nyone should be able to evaluate thereum’s security standards and compare these against other blockchains and legacy systems.nnho will contribute to this projectnnt the thereum oundation, the project will be driven by redrik vantes (rotocol ecurity ead) and osh tark ( management team) as the initial co-chairs of the project.nnhey will be supported by three ecosystem stewards who will help guide the project and provide input and advice.nnsamczsunnnsamczsun is the founder of the ecurity lliance () and works with leading technologists and researchers to secure the future of crypto. e got his start in crypto through responsibly disclosing dozens of critical vulnerabilities across various protocols and publishing technical writeups. e is also a security advisor at aradigm.nnehdi eroualinnehdi is a co-founder & director of igma rime, a leading blockchain security and research company. ehdi has been in the offensive information security industry for over  years and has performed hundreds of security assessments targeting critical infrastructure and applications. ith igma rime, ehdi leads a team of security engineers dedicated to the lockchain space, helping prominent projects secure their decentralized protocols.nnach brontnnach is a co-founder of therealize, where he is building products to move global financial infrastructure onto thereum. e spearheaded the initial build of  uccinct, the first full  validity proof version of the  stack. ach has been working in web security since , leading audit contests, working on private audits, and uncovering critical bugs to help secure the ecosystem.nne want your help!nnchieving rillion ollar ecurity is only possible with the support of the broad thereum ecosystem.nne want your perspective and input on where thereum’s security needs to improve. hether you are an individual user or a security auditing firm, we want to hear from you!nnf you or your organization is interested in contributing input, please do so throughnnthis formnnwhere we are collecting responses to help inform our work.nnf you are interested in sharing further information, we’re keen to have more in-depth discussions with stakeholders across the ecosystem. ou can reach us atnntrilliondollarsecurityethereum.org
