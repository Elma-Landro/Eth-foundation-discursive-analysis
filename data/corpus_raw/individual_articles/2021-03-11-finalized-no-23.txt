'vennspokennnabout these being terrible terms and wrote about it again in anuary'snn"he tate of th"nn.nnhat we call "eth" is a series of major upgrades to thereum'snnconsensus-layernn-- to ensure the protocol is secure, sustainable, and scalable -- while "eth clients" are implementations of this proof-of-stake consensus.nnnd, what we call "eth" in this contet is thereum's richnnapplication-layernn, and similarly, "eth clients" (after the upgrade to proof-of-stake) are the software that does the heavy lifting in this layer. thereum's application-layer is currently driven by a proof-of-work consensus algorithm but will soon be driven by the beacon chain -- the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that is currently in production and secured by ~. .nnow to follow through on my campaign, 'm rebranding this blog series. rom here on out, this series will be known as "inalized the thereum consensus-layer", where the name is an homage to the most critical function of the proof-of-stake consensus-layer --nnfinalitynn.nntakers pgrade your nodesnno stay connected, you must be erlin compatiblennhe thereum o chain is undergoing a mainnet upgrade, called erlin, on pril , . his is a backwards incompatible fork and thus requires updating your software to continue to follow mainnet. ou can read more about this in the 'snnthereum erlin pgrade nnouncementnn.nns a beacon chain staker, you need an thereum o endpoint to successfully perform all of your various duties as a validator. his functionality serves as the uni-directional link between the components of the system to allow for new validator deposits.nnt follows that, to successfully maintain this link,nnstakers must upgradenntheir thereum o nodes! f you run the yrmont testnet, you must upgrade your oerli nodesnnbefore arch nn, , and if you validate on mainnet, you must upgrade your mainnet o nodesnnbefore pril nn, .nnlso, a good time to upgrade your beacon nodennn addition to upgrading your o nodes,  highly recommend upgrading your beacon nodes too. here have beennnmanynnjuicy optimizations recently to all mainnet clients. o ensure your validators run with optimal performance (and profitability), pull down the latest release and give it a whirl.nnpgrade your nodes!nnðŸš€
