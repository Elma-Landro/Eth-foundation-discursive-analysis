Titre: Taylor’s Summer Update\nAuteur: Taylor Gerring\nDate: July 11, 2016\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/11/taylors-summer-update\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\ney everyone,  spent some time with our anadian friends in oronto after presenting "thereum he orld omputer" at lockchain raining onference last month and  wanted to provide a quick update on some of the eciting happenings in the thereum dev ecosystem. ots of things are brewing behinds the scenes, so let's jump in!nnrojectsnnistnnthereum wallet has been refined significantly over the last several months epanding support to arbitrary contract interaction via the "custom contracts" tab. his is a massive improvement over sending transactions on the command line, as was often required in rontier. ith several new team members doing work with the thereum oundation, new versions of ist are now rolling out and will incorporate improvements to eth and th as they are integrated. f you're using an old version, update tonnist ..nnfor the latest goodies.nncreenshot ist ..nneminnfter all the hard work spent reorganizing the ++ codebase, the  team has shifted gears from i to emi, as the  now targets the web. emi has hit it first alpha, and published with a demo online. heck out its repository atnnhttps//github.com/ethereum/reminnfor more info. n general,  s aren't yet popular, so this could be a major step forward in approachability, like thennonline olidity compilernnhas been. ew security tools, such asnnnnas epected to be released to the community. ork is also being done so that formal verification can detect recursive call patterns. ore details can be found in hristian'snn++  pdatenn.nnnniagram of eample  hierarchy with multiple recordsnnot an official project, but closely related to many projects, ick ohnson has started work on the thereum ame ervice. he encompasses smart contract-based resolvers with standard . he specification supports delegation by name component (separated by “.”) and multiple types of records. t’s possible to build gateways to plug-in to eisting systems, like . urrently, a draft specification withnna reference implementation is available in soliditynnand discussion is ongoing onnnitternn. his could have large implications for general usability of many services on thereum network from wallet aliases to friendly warm node names.nnrotocolsnnight clientnnomething to watch closely is light-client functionality enteringnnpublic testing phasenn. solt has been working on this code for months and the team looks poised to merge it into the main repo soon. he new code decreases chain sync time to under  mins from genesis block and under a minute when used week-to-week. his builds on top of work that eter did for the fast sync functionality that is now the default in ist (nn--fastnn). ore work is being done to improve log/receipt retrieval, and several iterations to the protocol is epected over time, so this is not the last you'll hear about !nnweet of light client running on embedded devicennwarmnnwarm is also being vigorously tested as o demonstrating economically self sustaining storage and distribution layers. iktor, ani, and aron have been working hard to ensure the code is as bug-free as possible before launching it on testnet. ick has developed a simulation script for network and communication verification which will go a long way towards this effort. ne of the eciting features of their work is the accounting & incentive systems allowing for long-term storage and retrieval of data. f you want to know more, the warm team has been featured in severalnnouube videosnnwhich eplains how everything works.nnata storage & retrieval on warmnnhough called many other names, this enables a vision for decentralized storage where you own your own data. urrently, while there are a few blockchain-based apps, full availability of warm will allow for those blockchain-backed apps to become full pps and run % decentralized inside ist.nn & aidennnn a collaborative note, continued discussion between the  and thereum teams may allow them to share a protocol in the future, allowing both ecosystems to benefit from their respective network effects. urther, work going towards aiden and warm turned out to be complementary as solutions were working towards solving similar problems. ’m told that the aiden etwork can be used as a payment channel for the warm incentive system, which would help address some privacy and scalability concerns while also multiplying their own efforts. nowing that they are reinforcing makes me even more ecited for what's in store for the future!nnrap-upnnevcon is right around the corner, with sessions scheduled for eptember , ,  during the lobal lockchain ummit in hanghai, hina. thereum oundation's information website is now online atnnethereumfoundation.org/devconnnand more information about the ummit can be found atnnblockchainweek.orgnn. espite having a larger venue, space will still be limited, so register now!nn hope  will prove to be a pivotal year for blockchains. / is improving rapidly over what was available just a couple years ago and with solutions like aiden for state/payment-channels, some of the privacy and scalability problems of blockchains are eased. ombined with research advancements targeted for erenity, we are on pace to overcome many of the obstacles italik once listed asnnhard problemsnn.nneep alm and ode n
