Titre: The Thawing Frontier\nAuteur: Stephan Tual\nDate: August 4, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/04/the-thawing-frontier\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nfter a smooth launch, please find a few updates of note below. hese probably will be of interest only to the more advanced users amongst you - if you’re not a miner, there is nothing to action.nnpoch switch in  hoursnnet’s start with a quick heads up to miners, the network will be switching epoch in roughly  hours. f you are using the geth/ethminer combo, you should be all set if you have opted to use thenn--autodagnnflag on geth andnn--no-precomputennon ethminer. f not, keep an eye on your miners as they generate thenndagnn. eport all issues to either thennonnornn++nnissue repositories, depending on which client you’re using.nnote that some  cards will require ___ tonnsupportnnthennlarger  sizenn.nnlient updates on the horizon.nnithin the net few days, we’ll see the k gas limit per block lifted. e’ll be operating with a  (, or pi million as it's affectionately called) gas target per block going forward.nnemember that it’s the protocol that defines the limits by how much the gas limit can increase (or decrease) per block, and that miners can only adjust their parameters within these limits.nnhe ma increase (or decrease) is set by the protocol at the parent gas limit /. ith the default parameter unaffected by miners, it will take a minimum of  hours to climb from the current k gas per block to a limit allowing transactions (, gas being required for a simple transaction on thereum).nnf course, statistically speaking, the more miners update their clients when the update is released, the faster the network will reach the  target (the minimum being  hours). o if you are mining, keep an eye out for releases of both thenn++nnandnnonnclients and make sure to update as soon as they hit.nnefault as price is set at  shannonnnhe default gas price is set at  shannon (nn. szabosnn, or . ether). emember that the gas price is ultimately always defined by the users calling a contract, while the miners can set a parameter on their machines to accept or ignore transactions that have a gas price within a certain range.nnn the user side of things, we also have a built-in oracle defining the optimal gas price, determined by the previous block gas usage. or eample, if the previous block was less than % full, the gas price oracle will adjust to a lower gas price recommendation.nnpdate on the lympic ewardsnne are currently compiling the list of lympic winners and will be processing them during the coming weeks.nnf you are epecting an lympic reward and were not able to do the - transaction  covered in one of mynnprevious blog postsnn, do not panic - you can still eecute that transaction on the lympic network.nnome of you reported issues with catching up to the lympic blockchain - in this instance, try the ++ client which synchronize in less than  hours. ote that you may have to mine a few blocks for your transaction to go through, as miners have now quite understandably moved on to rontier.nnpdate on nameregnnnce thawing has ended, we'll be looking in adding the name registrar contract. e haven't finalized its behaviour just yet, and its behaviour (similar to an auction house) will probably deserve its own blog post. ou can look at its current code published atnnhttps//github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/blob/master/registrar/registrar.solnn.nnnnouncements will always be made on our blognne thank you for your amazing support and participation on social media, includingnnwitternnand of coursennredditnn. ote that because so many of you are tracking a few sites for information on thereum, we decided to release all announcements going forward - including change to the protocol or clients - on this blog (the one you are reading now). inally, note that if you need answers to technical questions, you'll always be better served by our forums atnnhttp//forum.ethereum.org/nn.
