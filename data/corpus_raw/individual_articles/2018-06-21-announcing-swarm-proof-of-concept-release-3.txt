Titre: Announcing Swarm Proof-of-Concept Release 3\nAuteur: Viktor Trón\nDate: June 21, 2018\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/06/21/announcing-swarm-proof-of-concept-release-3\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe warm eam is pleased to announce the immediate release of warm client v., the third proof-of-concept release () of the thereum warm client. he  code is now merged into the officialnngo-ethereum repository's master branchnn.nnwarm . has been deployed to the public estnet, and the thereum oundation is running a -node strong cluster of warm nodes together with a public web gateway onnnhttps//swarm-gateways.netnn. e welcome everyone tonntry it outnnor commit to operate stable nodes.nnhe past yearnnt has been a year and a half since the first release of the  series was deployed andnnthe warm project launched its public alpha networknn.
wonnwarm summitsnn, twonnorange papersnnandnnforty thousand lines of codennlater, it is time to take stock.nnn the past year the warm team has grown in size and is now on fire delivering the vision. e have been busy redesigning the network layer, rewriting the retrieval protocol using a stream abstraction, rewriting connectivity management and the overlay network code as well as developed a sophisticatednnnetwork simulation frameworknnto test algorithmic correctness, scalability and fault tolerance of various subsystems.
 code was finalised just in time for thennwarm range ummit in jubljanann, where we had  participants and a very inspiring and creative week (nnwatch this two-minute video hosted on warmnn) of talks and coding. t is inspiring to see a growing number ofnncontributorsnnandnncompanies that want to build on swarmnn.nnwarm .nnwarm content storage is a lot more than just "bittorrent on steroids". he technical details can be found in thennchapter on architecturennin the new and improvednnwarm guidenn. ou'll find a more thorough academic presentation of warm's components in thennorange papersnnor learn more about warm through thennrecorded conference talksnn.nnn annnearlier blog postnn, we introduced the basics of warm storage and content distribution.nnt its core, warm is a service that provides s to upload and download content to the cloud and through -based addressing offersnnvirtual hosting of websitesnnand decentralised applications (dapps) without webservers, using decentralised peer-to-peer distributed infrastructure. he vision is that of a new internet which is not only fault-tolerant, has zero downtime and offers censorship resistance but is also economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system. y compensating nodes for contributing their bandwidth and disk space, these incentives aim to achieve reliable low-latency scalable retrieval of popular content on the one hand and guarantees persistence of important yet rarely accessed data like archives or backups on the other. or smooth delivery warm will use the  protocol (planned for .) while for storage guarantees it will use a two-tiered insurance system (planned for ).nneyond the basics of data storage and delivery, the   release includes some new and eperimental features.nnnnhe same pp connections that are used for data storage and delivery can also be used for node-to-node messaging.  combines warm routing (nnbzznn) with the hisper (nnshhnn) encrypted message format (nnbzznn+nnshhnnnnpssnn). n short,nnnnis a messaging protocol with strong privacy features running on top of the warm network. his messaging infrastructure can be the foundation of a whole new system of internode communication services (the email, tweet, newsletter of the future), hence, can be referred to asnnostal ervice over warmnn.nn is fully featured yet eperimental on the new  network and dapps can interact with it using a   . e are collaborating closely with companies and projects that want to use pss to build second-layer infrastructure.nnainframennis building a slack-alternative collaborative group communications tool (nnnynn) and their web , andnntatusnnhave epressed interest in building it into their mobile chat.nnutabilitynnnother eperimental new feature in  is the warm utable esource.
ypical in pp storage systems, content is addressed by its digital fingerprint (hash) and any changes to the content results in a change of this address. sers of the web, however, are accustomed to mutable resources when visiting s we epect to see the most up-to-date version of the 'site'. n order to make it easy to access changing content at permanent human-readable addresses, warm integrates with the thereum ame ervicenn()nnon the thereum blockchain. his is what allows us to reference warm content by names likennbzz//theswarm.ethnn.nnwarm  adds another layer in the form ofnnutable esource pdates ()nn. hese allow off-chain updates of content associated with an address at a potentially faster pace than  updates on the blockchain could support and without incurring the cost of on-chain transactions.nn is an eperimental feature in current  testnet and is still undergoing changes.nn supportnnnnenables users to integrate warm data directly into their local file systems (only on inu and ac). sing this system, users can "mount a warm manifest" as if it were a regular directory. t supports file system read and write operations, in which all content is automatically synced with the warm.
n future, combining  with warm utable esources, it should be possible, for eample, to sync your entire home folder between devices - the backend to a decentralised storage with a ropbo-like functionality.nnncryption supportnnwarm . comes with built-innnencryptionnnallowing for secure uploads of private data. he way encryption works users can upload a directory privately and still 'share' a subdirectory with specific peers.nnccess ontrol rees (warm ..) will offer an  for users to manage access to content independently of publishing it. ranted access will work across versions of resources.nnhe year aheadnnhe year ahead will be both eciting and challenging. s part of the  series we are planning to switch on a revamped  accounting system (warm ..) and enable 'light' warm nodes (warm ..).
mplementing erasure coding, proof of custody, insurance are also on thennroadmapnn.
e are on target delivering warm  (production beta prerelease) in .nne keep on building a community with our allies who champion the values of web and actively collaborate through working groups, building the foundational infrastructure, the backbone of second-layer services such as databases (nnhttp//wolk.comnn), private data management (nnhttp//datafund.ionn), rights and creative works licensing (nnhttp//jaak.ionn), decentralised version control (ethergit,nnhttp//epiclabs.ionn), video transcoding and streaming service (nnhttp//livepeer.orgnn), communication and collaboration (nnhttps//mainframe.comnn) andnnthe list is growingnn.nnontact snne welcome your feedback and contribution. ome find us in ournngitter channelnnor ournngithub repositorynn.
