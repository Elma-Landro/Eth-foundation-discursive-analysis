Titre: Edelweiss Interop Recap\nAuteur: EF Protocol Support\nDate: February 7, 2023\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/02/07/edelweiss-interop-recap\nCat√©gorie: Non cat√©goris√©\n\n==================================================\n\nith he erge now firmly behind us, protocol developers have been making progress across a (record) number of areas over the past few months. ithdrawals, danksharding, , verkle tries, history epiry,  and more have all seen significant progress recently!nnn order to help move each of these threads forward, and to run through one more series of hapella stress tests, client team members gathered in person for a week-long interop event in ustria delweiss üèîÔ∏ènnnlikennmphorann, which had a singular focus on he erge, this event had two major tracks, focused on the hapella and rotoanksharding network upgrades respectively. everal breakout sessions were also held to dive into other open problems. ere is a brief overview of what was accomplished, as well as links to artifacts from the workshops & ongoing discussion threads.nnhapellannhe week began with a hanghai/apella mainnet shadow fork. looding the network with withdrawal credential update messages revealed performance issues on the network, and led to a different consensus-layer queueing design to process these messages.nnhroughout the week, additional devnets were launched and stress tested with large amounts of credential updates, withdrawals, and even bad blocks. lient implementations ended the week hardened and ready for the fork on the newly-launchednnhejiang testnetnn.nnssuming the hapella upgrade happens without issue on hejiang, the epolia and oerli testnets will be upgraded net!nn(roto)ankshardingnnhe main - interop goal was the launch of an all-client - devnet. y riday, all but one client were syncing on the network!nneveral design discussions also took place during the week, stemming from anntransaction pool design proposalnn. uestions around allowing "blobless"  transactions, if and hownnblocks & blobs should be coupled for gossipnnand how to encode these transactions were discussed etensively and surfaced on last week'snnlloreevs ecution ayer callnn.nnver the net few weeks, teams hope to finalize all spec changes resulting from these discussions and launch a new devnet.nn bject ormat ()nnfter having been conditionally accepted and then removed from hanghai,  was one of the topics where opinions about the best path forward diverged the most.nnhether  shouldnnban code introspectionnn, aim for a minimal deployment , or evennnonlynnever go live on s were all discussed during the week.nno concrete specification came out of the workshop, but teams now have a shared understanding of the design space and potential paths forward. henn breakout roomsnnresumes net week to continue this conversation!nnverything lsennside from these three topics, teams discussed the future of light clients on the network, how the  &  specs processes could converge (and potentiallynncarve out s from other snn), launched a newnnerkle rie testnetnn, put forward a proposal tonn encode  transactionsnn, discussednnchanging the validator - deposit mechanicsnn, and even started annapella annotated specnn!nnet tepsnness than a week after the event, client teams have begun discussing hapella timelines for testnets. eep an eye out on this blog, as well as on clients' repositories, for announcements in the coming weeks!nnor other efforts, such as -, , , epect to see active design discussions in the coming weeks, leading to prototype implementations afterwards.nnhapella is almost here, and encun is clear on the horizon üåÖ
