evangelizing bitcoin and blockchain tech back in  my ad was a hard sell. here was the common skepticism and typical counters of “what’s backing it”, “what can be done with it” and “what the heck is cryptography" ack then my pitch wasn’t refined and the learning tools had just not quite matured yet...but frankly,  think more of the reason he didn’t grasp it was that he just isn’t technical and doesn’t adopt early tech.nn delicately persisted and he eventually came around. efore the end of  he had secured a nice stash of coins and as the price rose by many multiples  secured more and more of his ear for future opportunities that might arise.nnow he didn’t decide to buy itcoins because he ended up understanding the technology, in fact, ’m still not sure years later if he understands much of the bitcoin nitty-gritty or has wrapped his head around the potential implications that blockchain technology provides. hen thereum came along, he most certainly didn’t understand the concept and why  decided to drop everything in late  and risk sizable capital bootstrapping the project with my then co-founders italik, ihai, and harles, and eventually the rest of thennfounding teamnn, as it eists today.nnitcoin is comple to eplain, thereum takes it up a couple notches. t’s not rocket science but sure can seem like it to many people. nheard of terms like asnnsmart contractsnn,nnsmart propertynn, ornnappsnncan seem daunting to the masses. ven terms or words becoming more common such as “nncryptocurrencynn” or “nndistributed ledger systemnn” can still be unfamiliar to many. et’s face it. his technology is not easy for the majority to grasp and the messaging needs continual refinement and crafting for this to change.nnightly so, the majority of focus and current goal of thereum is to get the tools into the hands of developers and to show them how they can create the products end users will eventually value. ess time and resources have been spent eplaining thereum to end consumers, enterprise, and institutions.nnith weekly announcements of “blockchain integrations” (eenn,nnnn,nnonduran overnmentnnand countless others) andnnfriendly legislation proposalsnnemerge from countries like anada, there’s obvious increased interest from many sectors and as more integration projects start hitting the news, more and more interest gets sparked from organizations not wanting to get left behind.nnplaining omple deasnno how do we get thereum, and in general, comple ideas to the general public ell, whether it's a company trying to communicate new innovations to investors, or an educator teaching a challenging topic in a brief amount of time,nnthe problem is how do you take an abundance of mostly technical information and effectively simplify and present if in an engaging and informative waynnne answer is infographics. ere are a few benefits of this mediumnnnfographics are more eye-catching than printed words since they usually combine images, colors and content that naturally draw the eye and appeal to those with shorter attention spans.nnnfographics are etremely shareable around the web using embed code and are perfect for social network sharingnnf visually appealing with consistent colors, shapes. messages and logo they provide an effective means of brand awarenessnnellow is the concept of the first general infographic for thereum designed for the masses. ’ll allow it to speak for itself and  welcome feedback and questions as to why we crafted the message the way we did or why certain terms or ideas were left out. lease feel free to share this and help get the message around the web.nnhis is the first of a few proposed infographics. he net one will focus more on thereum use cases for various sectors, then one for the more technically inclined.nn’m missing father’s day with my ad (and my brother's first fathers day) to be in witzerland on thereum business. owever  did see my ad this week and felt a certain accomplishment when after showing him the infographic he told me “ finally have a clue what thereum is and its potential. ow what’s all this talk about itcoin”nnappy father’s day to all you fathers out there from
