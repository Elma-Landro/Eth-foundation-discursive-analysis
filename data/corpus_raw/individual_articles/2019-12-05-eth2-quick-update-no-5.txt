testnets to come in the net month.nnou can now pull down the hasper codebase and with a few commands, and connect to the apphire testnet. f you want to give it a shot, follow the instructionsnnherenn.nnth block eplorers launchnnotnnonennbutnntwonn(!) eth block eplorers recently launched. oth of these block eplorers currently monitornnrysmatic abs' apphire estnetnn, providing slot-by-slot info as validators build the beacon chain.nnitfly launched theirnnbeaconcha.innnblock eplorer a couple of weeks ago and continue to addnneciting featuresnnby the day. therscan just launched theirnnblock eplorernnyesterday, and it, too, looks packed with cool features and data. oth will be great options to monitor rysmatic's and other testnets as they come online.nne're ecited to see more and more user/developer tooling being built around eth clients and testnets )nnirst eth networking callnnp until this point, we've relied upon github issues/pull-requests, adhoc chats, the main eth call, and in person meetings to organize the networking components of the eth spec. his has largely workednnwell enoughnn, but researching and architecting a network to support a sharded blockchain protocol is an issue that increasingly deserves some more specific attention and resources.nno this end, we had our firstnneth networking-specific callnnthis week. lthough this call is not live-streamed like the general eth call, it is public and open to all contributors. hank you to the pp networking eperts across the various eth teams that pushed for this call.  was originally resistant due to the additional coordination overhead, but the first call proved very fruitful and  look forward the net.nns always en dgington (nncall notesnn) and amy atsimbazafy (nncall notesnn) took ecellent notes. e still have plenty to dig into, and our net call will be in approimately  weeks time.nnirst eth phase  community callnnhank you ill illanueva from the uilt team for organizing thennfirst eth phase community callnn. imilar to the new networking and light client calls, phase  has enough going on to warrant a regular call to keep the research and development more organized.nnhis first call acted as a general update and survey of the various on-going threads across the many teams and individuals involved. ou can read up on the notesnnherenn. ubsequent calls are intended to be deeper work sessions on specific technical issues.nn major goal for hase  is to get through the initial wave of stateless protocol research and to use the findings to narrow the scope into a more concrete plan to eecute in . hese calls are an ecellent step forward toward this goal.nnorkchoice state finnesearchers at an ose tate niversity led by an  hang have been diligently working to formalize the joint properties of eth's consensus mechanics (asper ) and fork choice rule ( ). efore publishing their work, they found a corner case in the interworkings of + in which a branch of the block tree might include the latest justified/finalized blocks butnnnotnnactually show those blocks as justified/finalized in the on-chain state. o leave such "non-viable" branches in the fork choice can lead to situations in which a validator's vote might not be coherent with local finality info and might, in certain scenarios, lead to liveness failures. ou can read more about this particular scenario and the proposed solutionnnherenn.nno address this scenario, we have annfi under reviewnnin the specs repo. e epect this fi to be released within the week.nnpecification and implementation of the new  standardsnnhe long-awaited  standards were recently presented for public comment at thenn eeting nn. ou can check out thennpresentationnnandnnslidesnnfor yourself. he presentation went as planned and the standard is epected to be adopted by a number of blockchain projects and (nneventuallynn) into . o more semi-officially enshrine this standard before the long  process finsihes,  epect the  and many other projects to more officially announce intended usage soon.nnhere are two draft pull-requests (nnnn] nnnn]) under review in the specs repo, as well as an implementation of the new standardnnunder review innnpy_eccnn. nce review is complete, we will generate the new  test vectors for general consumption by eth clients. he intention is to switch testnets over to the modified  scheme come anuary.nnhe  standards also remove one of the final blockers for launching the eth deposit contract. untime erification is currently finishing up their report on the formal verification and analysis of the deposit contract bytecode. his report is epected to be published by the end of the month for public review, after which we cannnfinallynnlaunch this thing ðŸš€.
