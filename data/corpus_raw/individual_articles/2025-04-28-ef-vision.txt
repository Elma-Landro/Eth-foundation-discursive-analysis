Titre: The Ethereum Foundation’s Vision\nAuteur: Aya Miyaguchi and Vitalik Buterin\nDate: April 28, 2025\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/04/28/ef-vision\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nthereum’s strength lies in its decentralization — not just technically, but socially and structurally. his blog articulates the 's vision, its role, and priorities as one of the ecosystem's stewards. e use this moment as an opportunity to restate our vision, principles and values which we continue to uphold as we welcome the new management team. hese priorities are not a rigid plan and are reflected in thennstrategies described by ’s o-snn. y defining our approach and focus, we also aim to clarify where we direct our efforts — and where we intentionally step back — so that the ecosystem can continue to thrive with everyone's participation.nnisionnno steward the nfinite arden — the ecosystem of projects, communities, and infrastructure built around thereum — to remain resilient amid changing environments. e uphold thereum as humanity’s shared world computer, an open and permissionless platform that is already bringing stability, freedom and technologically-empowered collaboration to millions of people worldwide. e honor the fact that thereum is already in use, creating real value for communities across the globe.nnn that spirit, we embrace the metaphor of the nfinite arden to describe the thereum ecosystem a living, evolving space where builders, dreamers, and stewards from around the world can plant ideas and support each other as we build the tools that will redefine finance, identity and other roots in the soil of our civilization for decades to come.nnur olennthereum’s greatest advantage is its unparalleled ecosystem. here are many teams and organizations outside of  that contribute to thereum by pushing its boundaries forward, through technical innovations, educational events, and by funding public goods. he thereum oundation eists to strengthen this advantage and to uphold thereum's core values. e identify gaps, correct imbalances, and support critical initiatives — always ensuring that no single actor (including ) can dominate thereum’s evolution. e step in strategically and step out intentionally, continuously adjusting our focus as thereum matures and the environment evolves.nny practicing purposeful subtraction, we’ve empowered others in the ecosystem to take on the majority of responsibilities. oday, we see our role as twofoldnne do what no one else can do today.nne help others do tomorrow what only we can do today.nnhis means focusing on high-leverage areas where ’s unique position allows us to support the ecosystem in ways few others can — while also building capacity and infrastructure so others can eventually take the lead. elow are eamples of how this shows up in practicennhere we step in to do what no one else can todaynnunding and maintaining

complete within the net  months, and on longer-term efforts that will define thereum’s role for the net decade.nnupporting zero-knowledge research and open-source tooling that pushes the frontier of

sustainable, multi‑generational impact and recognizing that lasting resilience requires continuous learning, adaptation, and evolution.nntewardship of aluesnne protect and nurture thereum’s core values —nncensorship resistance, open source, privacy, and securitynn— while empowering the ecosystem to grow and evolve independently. e preserve these essential qualities as the foundation for lasting innovation and progress.nnurposeful ubtractionnnather than accumulate power, we design for resilience bynnaintaining a plurality of approaches, solutions, and teamsnnnabling diverse participationnnacilitating collaborationnneducing centralizationnnuilding resilience isn’t about doing less. t often requires adding new mechanisms or compleity — but always with the goal of creating an anti‑fragile ecosystem that distributes power and ownership broadly.nnoals headnns we move through a pivotal time and into the years ahead, our direction is shaped by a clear vision. eams are deeply engaged, and active projects are already in motion to support thereum’s continued evolution. he work ahead isn’t about hitting benchmarks — it’s about focusing our energy where it matters most. o help guide our collective focus, we’ve outlined a few impact areas — tangible outcomes that anyone in the thereum ecosystem can contribute toward.nnhese goals are not static they will continue to evolve alongside the ecosystem and the needs of the world around us.nnhe thereum oundation’s role is to identify high-leverage gaps — the places where it is uniquely positioned to contribute — and direct its efforts toward the greatest possible impact.nnoal aimize the number of people who (directly or indirectly) use thereum, in such a way that they benefit from thereum’s underlying values.nnhat meaningful usage can look likennnnnternet-native financial accessnn eople using tokenized assets on thereum or ei for payments, savings and wealth building – particularly where fiat infrastructure is limited, unreliable or charges etortionate fees, or where the infrastructure is reliable today but can easily become unreliable tomorrow.nnnternet-native organizationsnn eople participating in s with programmable incentive structures that enable new forms of coordination, decision-making, and capital formation that transcend the limitations of traditional approachesnnecentralized social mediann eople using an thereum-based social media platform where content is stored in a decentralized network, allowing users to switch clients without giving up their

agents can coordinate with each other and human beings (eamples micro prediction markets)nnnterprise benefitsnn eople using an institutional application that uses thereum on the backend. f built correctly, this can provide benefits such as auditability, privacy, interoperability and “escape hatch” mechanisms even if users normally interact with the app through servers without a wallet (eamples on-chain-enforced limits to monetary issuance ability to eit assets to  and interact with  ei ability to zk-prove credentials to arbitrary third-party apps)nnhat it’snnnotnnnnustodial wallets

vulnerability (e.g.  clients that actually use most of the same code base, events in  countries that are run by the same centralized organization)nns we work toward these impact areas, we also remain grounded in a long-term perspective — one that sees thereum not just as a technology, but as a living ecosystem with the potential to serve humanity for generations to come.nne envision a future where thereum serves as a resilient, neutral platform for global coordination. hat means that decentralization must remain preserved in both development and governance, innovation will flourish at every layer of the stack, and communities around the world can craft and sustain their own adaptive solutions. e believe the network’s technical and social resilience will only continue to grow stronger, and  will do everything within its vision and ability to ensure that we succeed together.
