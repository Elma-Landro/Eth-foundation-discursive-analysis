Titre: Grantee Roundup: January 2022 - Japan Local Grants Edition!\nAuteur: Ecosystem Support Program Team\nDate: February 24, 2022\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/02/24/japan-local-grants-round\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nn today’s roundup, we’re ecited to feature four recipients from a recent ocal rants wave in apan! e see thereum as an ever-growing, creative and inclusive playground, and it is our responsibility to let everyone keep playing.nnt’s not easy to commit to public goods or novel use cases without a quick financial return, and it’s important to support the dedicated teams working to solve interesting problems, improve public infrastructure and build creative blockchain use cases. n this ocal rants round, the thereum oundation is happy to shine a spotlight on a local community proactively working to demonstrate the potential of decentralized technology.nnzknn ero-knowledge onfidential eliable thereum nonymous iernnzkonfidential eliable thereum nonymous ier is a set of protocols and dapps which enables more robust, accessible, secure, anonymous, and verifiable voting for public elections in apan. zk is developed as a pilot program. t consists of a set of smart contracts and user-friendly interface app that allows the average general public to vote in a completely anonymous fashion while maintaining the integrity and verifiability of the final vote tallies. t also supportsnnnnmaking it more collusion resistant, reliable, and anonymous.nnhe team’s net focus of the development is to build both mobile and desktop voting application that are easy to use. t will showcase and leverage the use of zk in the thereum community. n addition, the team will develop additional voting logic layers to support other common scenarios, such as quadratic voting, instant runoff voting, and ranked-choice voting.nnyodan ystem nn uilding ayer  with zkollups and zkloudnnhe yodan team works on problems of scalability, privacy, and code compleity. hey take a multi-faceted approach that incorporates both protocol &, and building tools to make zero knowledge proofs more accessible to developers.nnhennzkloudnnservice aims to help developers use zero-knowledge proofs to write smart contracts and programs more easily. zkloud currently supports roth and  proofs, with s coming soon. he team is also developing an optimized zk ust library, along with other tools to enable a no-code approach to zero knowledge-based applications.nnhe team is also developing a new zk-rollup, based on a designnnproposednnby  eona ioki. he approach offers potential privacy and efficiency improvements by not requiring transaction history data for contract eecution.nntartrailnn ecords nfrastructure for hysical and igital rtworknntartrail is an thereum-based infrastructure for recording the provenance and ehibition history of both physical and digital artwork. n addition to using  to represent an artwork or its certificate,  chips can be attached to physical artworks and associated with the certificate on the blockchain.nn aihei himself is a contemporary artist who was inspired to use blockchain technology to solve pain points he eperienced in the art industry. ince , he has built a team of people from both art and technical backgrounds who are inspired by the possibilities of distributed ledger technology to solve problems of provenance and compliance in art ownership. hey work with people from the art industry, such as artists, gallerists, curators and web-based marketplaces, to make sure that they meet their practical needs in operation.nnhe team’s net goals include open sourcing their smart contracts and epanding their infrastructure to the global market. dvocating for the rights of all people in the art industry, including artists and collectors, they hope to bring all kinds of art industry participants into the thereum ecosystem.nnwa.ionn mart ock uthentication for hysical evicesnna.io uses thereum to verify usage rights for physical devices. he team first eplored the concept in  in annjoint eperimentnnwithnnara nstitute of cience and echnology ()nnin which they trialed a blockchain-based system for automated car sharing on the  campus.  “virtual key” allowed an authorized user to lock and unlock a car with their smartphone, and users were incentivized to return cars to locations where they would be in the highest demand.nna.io builds on the concept and learnings from the  pilot, using digital signatures to authenticate authorized operators of physical devices even while offline. he team hopes it can be applied to many use cases to make it easier to bring thereum into the real world!nnamieenn artnership ertificates on thereumnnamiee is a non-profit dedicated to helping all types of families access the benefits available to legally married couples through a platform for issuing partnership certificates on thereum.  network of participating corporations provide services for couples who hold amiee certificates, giving them access to benefits that would otherwise only be available to legally married couples such as employee family benefits, joint mortgage applications, family discounts, public assistance or life insurance.nnamiee began issuing certificates for same-se partners in ebruary , and plans to etend the service to include other types of families and partnerships that are not legally recognized in certain places, such as marriages where women choose to keep their original names or single mothers living together to support each other. hey are currently working on a mobile app to issue certificates that meet a high standard for privacy protection, security and .nnnspiration from the ommunitynnountless local thereum communities around the world are a big part of why thereum feels simultaneously global and personal for so many people. ccordingly, we are continuously eperimenting with ways to support local communities around the world.nngain, thank you to all of the contributors who are promoting thereum adoption in the real world, and if you think you’re the net one, please head to ournngrants pagennto learn more about what we look for in the projects we fund.
