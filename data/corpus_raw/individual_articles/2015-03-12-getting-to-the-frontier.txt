Titre: Getting to the Frontier\nAuteur: Vinay Gupta\nDate: March 12, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/12/getting-to-the-frontier\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\no first some background. e’ve already covered a little about what to epect from rontier in thennthereum aunch rocessnnblog post and av has given us anncomprehensive overview of the state of the development effortnn. ou can also read about some of the ongoing security work,nnincluding the bug bounty systemnn. he bug bounty program has found my favorite bug so farnnonas icknn's discovery thatnnyou could send a negative payment to somebody which moves value from their account to yours!nns bug bounty finds go, an absolute gem. ell done!nnav has a new blog post describing a little more about what the thorny end of the development process looks likenncreating a precise specification for thereum by keeping three different implementations in syncnn, rather than having a canonical implementation which implicitly defines the protocol spec and which other versions then become bug-for-bug compatible with. his is a pretty tough-minded and thorough approach to putting together a system, and it’s worth reading to get a flavor of how the engineering work is going.nny now you should have a pretty good sense of what the development process looks like, and the disparate threads of work which are being woven together into the release. o let’s talk about what actually has to get done between now and rontier.nnhere arennfour specific challengesnnfor us to meet on rontier.nnecuritynnetwork tabilitynniningnnchangennwo of those, ining and change are partnership efforts people have to take our software and run it, in concert with their own tooling in some cases, to provide services as part of the ecosystem. emember, we’re launching an ecosystem, not just a product everything is part of that ecology. ach one of these aspects of the release process has to work, both on its own, and with the others for the ecosystem to actually get a proper test under load.nnn additionnnll software has to be reasonably easy to install, mining includednne need to support partners, particularly echanges, to provide servicesnne need to build our checkpointing and blockchain integrity testing servicesnnll within the contet of the rontier environment in which we make strong guarantees about network integrity (more on this later) at the cost of the risk of network rollbacks if/when we discover unepected network behaviors or other problems.nneasonably good progress is being made on all fronts. ather than giving you a release date, and then risking that under pressure to meet that date, something will slip through the gaps that another day of work would have caught, we are going to tick off items in the release process as we go. his will let you get have a sense of how far out from the launch we are on any given day, without us basically making a guess at how long it will all take, publishing our guess, and then hoping we can make reality to the calendar as we said before, this is a security-driven not a schedule-driven process. e can make that process fairly transparent to you, and provide summary information so you don’t have to watch the repositories - but we would rather bring you into the process so you understand what is happening and how the work is going than give you an aggregate date and keep you guessing as to the actual state of the work. e feel this approach is more transparent, better suited to a crowdfunded development process, and overall simply more realistic.nnf you would like to see the current state of play, effrey ilcke (nnlead on the o clientnnand the msterdam hub) has anno client issue tracker for rontiernn.nnhisnnissue listnnis the best reference for the rontier release right now,  issues closed,  open. ew issues will get raised, and of course issue count is only a very loose proy for “ship time” but the work done is the best indicator, so look there if you would like to prognosticate.nnlease note this is not to say that we are running on “nnalve imenn” (even though alve ime does produce some spectacular products!) e have open development processes, you can see the code being written, download the latest branches, participate in testing. t’s not all hidden behind a company  wall. ut we are running on “releasing innovative software with huge associated security processes” time, and schedule estimation for things which have never been done before is not going to help anybody part of the benefit of the way thereum was funded over conventional funding models is that we can do what is right in the medium- and long-term, rather than being under constant market pressure for net quarter’s numbers.nne will say this there will be at least two weeks notice before anything goes live. ou’ll get plenty of news from blog posts, you’ll see the issue count go down, and we’ll start saying positive things about security audit feedback and so on. e will keep you in the loop!nnhat about the feature list e’ve largely gone over this in the aunch rocesses post, but to reiterate rontier will...nne command-line client onlynnine at % of the normal rate, but this will be real thernnnclude the full blockchain feature set including smart contracts and logs, although everything ecept account balances will be erased when omestead is launchednne are working with echanges to make  convertible during rontiernnor security, the block chain will be checkpointed manually every  hours, and any reported anomalies will be investigatednnfficial echanges will use this checkpointing service to protect traded assets from potential blockchain rollbacksnnn particularly severe cases of failure, the oundation may stop checkpointing rontier completely and release a client upgradennn short, we’re doing everything possible to make rontier a safe place to test thereum with real value, but we are also strongly discouraging people from using ther on the rontier network which they are unwilling to lose.nnrontier is intended largely for people who are writing and testing tooling for mining and echanges, and perhaps a few of the more hardy dpp developers. t is not a general release that we epect ordinary users to interact with at all, although you might download a client and mine a little ther just because you can. he show really starts at omestead, and we’ll have more news about omestead’s features laternnore news as  have it, and keep watching the skies!
