Titre: The Business Imperative Behind the Ethereum Vision\nAuteur: William Mougayar\nDate: May 24, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/05/24/the-business-imperative-behind-the-ethereum-vision\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\npecial thanks to italik uterin, avin ood and effrey ilcke for countless revisions feedback, picks at their brains, and helping me read their tea leaves.nnntroductionnnn the world of cryptography-based computer science, the thereum technology vision has captivated the imagination of a large number of software developers and technologists who saw its obvious promise. ut those same promises and their business interpretations (and implications) have not widely reached, nor been well understood by non-technical audiences.nns thereum nears coming out of the “labs” and into the market, it is even more important that its message be widely understood by the business community.nnhe purpose of this article is to answernnwhy thereum matters, why non-technical people should care, and why we need another global blockchainnn, even if itcoin already is one. hese are a few key questions, and for each one of them, the more you dive into the answers, the more you start to understand them, and the more you will appreciate thereum’s unique position, while learning that its approach has merits and longevity.nnummarynnthereum is an alternative decentralized ledger protocol, not an alternative cryptocurrency. thereum’s ideological lineage contains as much itorrent, ava and reenet as it does itcoin. rom a product perspective, it is a general-purpose, global blockchain that can govern both financial and non-financial types of application states.nnn its essence, thereum powers decentralized business logic, also known as smart contracts, represented as cryptographic "boes" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met. his business logic eecutes on the blockchain cloud (no server hosting is required), and automatically enforces the terms of a given agreement between a number of parties. hey are a building block for “Ðpps”, the new form of ecentralized pplications that thereum ecels at. nd from a front-end (client) point of view, thereum has a powerful special-purpose browser enabling users to install and interact with any Ðpp in a user-friendly manner.nnhe outcome of this new patchwork of technologies is an emerging eb infrastructure which thereum is particularly good at enabling. t is based on a -tier architecture, comprising an advanced browser as the client, the blockchain ledger as a shared resource, and a virtual network of computers that run smart business logic programs in a decentralized way.nnompared to itcoin, thereum has built a new crypto-technology based framework that provides even larger gains in ease of development as well as even stronger light-client properties, while at the same time allowing applications to share a viable economic environment, and solid blockchain security.nnhe genius behind thereum is this magical network of computers that enables a new type of software applications the truly decentralized ones, based on embedding the logic of trust inside small programs and distributing them to run on its blockchain.nnhis has several implications for developers, incredible cost savings and efficiency in writing new applications and for non-technical users, a chance to reimagine eisting businesses, or create new opportunities, based on unbundling central functions and relegating them to decentralized constructs. thereum helps anyone wishing to develop decentralized applications, encode arbitrarily comple contractual business logic, launch autonomous agents, and manage relationships that will be mediated entirely by the blockchain.nnthereum is a form of specialized cloud computing, albeit one that allows substantial gains in efficiency and cost-effectiveness, where very strong guarantees of security and reliability are required. nd it comes with a complete suite of tools for building applications on it.nnhe thereum transaction ledger can be used to securely eecute a wide variety of services including voting systems, domain name registries, financial echanges, crowdfunding platforms, company governance, self-enforcing contracts and agreements, intellectual property, smart property, and distributed autonomous organisations.nnthereum is spurring business and societal innovation at the global level, while opening the door to a new class of applications, never seen before. n the long term, the resulting outcome will impact economic and control structures.nnhousands of entrepreneurs and developers are already creating and implementing new ideas, projects and startups based on thereum. nd for eisting organizations, business and  leaders and entrepreneurs are encouraged to eplore how thereum enables them to reengineer or innovate on top of their eisting services, in order to remain competitive in the future.nnnderstanding thereumnno, why is it so difficult to understand thereum or the same reason that it’s difficult to understand itcoin, and for the same reason the nternet was difficult to grasp by the general public until at least  years after the beginning of its commercialization. hat reason is they all have multiple functional identities. ranted, that answer is not particularly enlightening, but it is factual itcoin, thereum and the nternet mean different things for different people. ut their narrative is strong, because their impact is multi-faceted and far reaching. o let’s dissect thereum in order to make it more comprehensible.nnthereum vs. itcoinnns a starting point, and only as a reference, we could begin by comparing thereum to itcoin, because itcoin seems to have been understood, at least by those who wished to understand it.nnt first sight, one can easily be duped by apparent similarities because both itcoin and thereum are open source platforms that have four common staples an underlying cryptocurrency, an inherent blockchain, a decentralized consensus-based proof mechanism, and miners that support the network therefore they must be similar. ut that is a wrong conclusion. s soon as you dig deeper, reality reveals that itcoin and thereum are more dissimilar than similar. ach one of these  staples has a fundamentally different purpose in terms of what it enables, and for that reason, thereum is headed into a different direction than itcoin.nnor background, itcoin was originally designed as a decentralized cryptocurrency network for transacting monetary value, and the main purpose of the itcoin blockchain was that backbone of trust for these financial transactions. t was only more recently that itcoin's blockchain started to find use cases in non-financial applications relating to decentralized trust and as a store of value. herefore, the programmability aspects of the itcoin blockchain itself were almost an after-thought, although sidechain proposals are hoping to make this programmability a little easier. n contrast, thereum was conceived from ay  as a software development platform for decentralized applications, and its blockchain was specifically designed to support eecuting apps on it. o, the thereum design had the luury of learning from itcoin’s eperience and remedied some of its shortcomings. or eample, the thereum blockchain is faster at performing verifications, down to a typical range between  and  seconds, as compared to itcoin’s  mins.nnhe thereum paradigm revolves around being a network for powering decentralized applications in need of a deterministic, auditable and predictable compute platform, and that is different from the essence of the itcoin paradigm whose trivial compute machinery is currency-centric. herefore, you cannot blindly apply itcoin analogies pertaining to the role of mining, the cryptocurrency usage, and the programmability capabilities of the respective blockchains in order to fully understand thereum.nnirst, the thereum’s cryptocurrency (called “ether”) is not similar to the itcoin currency because its main purpose is not for payment of goods or services, nor to be a "digital gold" version, two features that itcoin ecels at, and that thereum doesn't even attempt to provide. ther is more like an incentive plumbing in the form of required “crypto-fuel” to pay for the transaction fees necessary to run the various smart business logic programs that users submit to its blockchain.nn close analogy is to compare ether to cloud-based computational costs. hen you run an application in the cloud, you are charged based on a combination of time, storage, data transfer and computing speed requirements.nnhe novelty with ether-based costing is that you are paying to run the business logic on the blockchain. t’s a form of cloud-based micro-value pricing that un-bundles a layer from the traditional cloud computing stack.nnn addition to being that network fuel, ether will also be tradeable as a cryptocurrency on a variety of open echanges, but it is epected that its value appreciation will be more rationally influenced by the volume and richness of transaction demands than by currency speculators (which is the opposite to what has happened to itcoin).nnecond, the thereum blockchain is fully programmable by design, and more economically efficient than itcoin. t is arguably more scalable, a key requirement pertaining to the long term affordability of a busy blockchain. ecause it is not focused on fulfilling financial transactions, the thereum blockchain's purpose is different than itcoin's. echnically, thereum doesn’t have a limit on the block size, and it will adjust dynamically as a whole, as part of its core design. n addition, thereum is continuing to work on improving the scalability aspects, and that will have a direct benefit of lowering the overall transaction costs.nnn general, when looking at desirable features for a blockchain, the following characteristics come to mind, and they are ones that thereum ecels atnnrogrammabilitynncalabilitynnpgradabilitynnransactions anageabilitynnisibilitynnffordabilitynnecuritynnpeed/erformancennigh vailabilitynntensibilitynnhird, whereas proof-of-work is thereum’s current consensus process choice, it is planned to evolve into a less wasteful method known as the “proof-of-stake”. roof-of-stake has been proven to be an efficient and viable consensus method that is cheaper to operate while being more epensive to attack.nninally, mining in the thereum contet can be done by regular computers, and doesn’t require the specialized computational horsepower that itcoin requires, therefore thereum's mining will be more affordable and accessible to the masses. nyone running the thereum mining client software on their computer can become an thereum miner, almost like itorrent allows any user to openly share their media files. his is a good strategy, because it makes thereum more affordable, by not being overly dependent on epensive mining. his also means that, unlike itcoin thereum does not depend on accumulating a lot of mining power to work. t is more biased towards self-maintenance via a healthy balance of affordable mining and pay-per-play computing requirements.nnthereum as reenetnnhere is another interesting (and perhaps unepected) thereum analogy, and it is towardsnnreenetnn. or background, reenet was an earlier way of making decentralized websites. t was free software that allowed users to anonymously share files, browse and publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through reenet) and chat on forums, without fear of censorship, and with less vulnerability to attack. reenet’s philosophical underpinning was to enable and protect censorless freedom of speech, and to spread knowledge.nnreenet’s ideology had merits, but it also had two main flaws with known causes that thereum remedies. irst, downloading a website would often take more than one minute. econd, it had no applications, and contained static content only. thereum addresses these issues squarely via its native incentivization, and via its blockchain which is a backbone for enabling applications.nnore thereum ifferentiationnno, what are additional features of thereum that differentiate it further and make it an attractive choice for developing decentralized applicationsnnhe evelopment anguagesnnrguably, thereum’s software development language capabilities are one of its biggest differentiating features, because programming the blockchain is a primordial objective. thereum doesn't have one, but it has four such special-purpose languages erpent (nnythonnninspired), olidity (avacript inspired), utan (nnonninspired) and  (nnispnninspired).nns one of the high-level programming languages used for thereum, erpent (as suggested by its name) is designed to be very similar to ython. t is intended to be maimally clean and simple, combining many of the efficiency benefits of a low-level language with ease-of-use in programming style.nnolidity is the preferred language, being designed from the ground-up for contract-oriented programming and the one under the most development. t inherits all the erpent qualities, but with a similar synta to avacript which gives it a familiar adoption advantage that minimizes the barrier to entry, because avacript is commonly used by eb developers. herefore, olidity leverages an eisting skillset that millions of programmers already possess.nnnother key feature of the thereum blockchain is its “uring-completeness”, an important characteristic needed to ensure a high degree of universal solvability while running the required computation puzzles. ore precisely, it is “quasi” uring-complete, because through setting up-front limits on the amount of computation allowed, it avoids the non-termination problem of a fully uring-complete language.nnurthermore, because thereum’s languages are specifically designed for that blockchain, they provide incredible real-time granularity on transaction visibility and activity, a desirable feature that itcoin has some challenges with. ith itcoin, you need to import the blockchain database, parse all transactions and query them in order to etract activity intelligence on it  whereas with thereum, you may issue specific address requests in real-time on the live blockchain.nnthereum nables Ðppsnnhe available multiplicity of thereum development languages is important because it enables developers to pick the ones they like in order to more easily and efficiently write ecentralized pplications (Ðpps).nn Ðpp is the combined set of smart contracts and client-side code that enables them. mart contracts are like cryptographic "boes" that contain a value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met. hey typically encapsulate some logic, rules, a process, or an agreement between parties. hen they are launched on thereum, the network enforces their ramifications.nn Ðpp can be viewed architecturally as being very similar to a traditional web application, with one difference in a traditional web application, you have client side avascript code that is run by users inside their browsers and server-side code that is run by a host or company but in a Ðpp, you instead have smart logic running on the blockchain, and client side code running in ist, the special browser.nnurthermore, a Ðpp can interact or connect with other web apps or other decentralised technologies. or e.g., a Ðpp may use a decentralized messaging service such as hisper in this thereum’s contet, or a decentralized file distribution like . n the web apps side, a company such as oogle might want to get data from a decentralized reputation service, or a loomberg data feed may want to interface with a financial Ðpp.nnhe thereum lientnnthereum includes a special purpose client browser that enables users to run the variety of available Ðpps and launch smart contracts. his browser (called ist) is a user-friendly launching pad that promises to making smart contracts and Ðpps widely accessible to a broad community of users.nnist is ground-breaking in terms of lowering the user adoption barrier. ts impact isn’t unlike what the web browser did for accessing the nternet in a user-friendly manner, or what iunes represented for downloadable digital content.nnist has special security layers, key management, decentralized account management (i.e. the user accounts are owned by the user and not a central third party authority), and includes blockchain-related components that will make it an indispensable tool for running or managing blockchain-specific decentralized applications for the average user who doesn’t need to understand technical aspects.nnrom a user eperience point of view, you use Ðpps from inside of ist just as you interact with websites via a regular browser. or e.g., a pure Ðpp such as ugur (a prediction market) lives inside the thereum ist browser. owever, there can also eist services delivered through a regular browser in a more traditional web . manner that are still powered by and auditable through thereum.nnhe thereum irtual achinennhen you think of these self-contained logic scripts that run on the blockchain, store data on it, and return some value(s) to the originator, it’s like running a program virtually in the cloud. imply said, these smart contracts are the code running on the thereum irtual achine (). herefore, this is similar to a decentralized virtual computation service, ecept that it’s without the burden of web servers, and it is designed to be run by all participants in a peer-to-peer network that can read and write data and code to the blockchain safely and securely (via cryptographically secured digital signatures).nnhe concept of the thereum irtual achine () is a very important one, becausennit is another primary innovation of the thereum project.nnf you don't understand the , you don't understand thereum.nno, the  "sits on the blockchain", but it’s actually made-up of several interconnected computers that anyone can upload programs to, leaving these programs to self-eecute, and ensuring that current and all previous states of every program are always publicly visible. hese programs run on the blockchain and continue to eecute in eactly the way that the  specifies. his allows anyone to create their own business logic for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions.nnhe thereum ore and its cosystemnnt its inner core, thereum is a multi-layered, cryptography-based, technical protocol that is open source. ts various functional pieces are fully integrated by design, and the sum of its components turns it into a comprehensive platform for building and deploying modern decentralized applications.nnt was designed as a general-purpose decentralized application platform, with a full suite of tools that etend its functionality and power.nnlthough thereum looks like a combination of several interconnected open source projects, its evolution has been clearly guided by a crystal vision to ensure that all the pieces fit together synergistically.nnike any major software platform, the thereum core is augmented by a rich ecosystem comprised of a community of partners, technology interchange etensions, applications and ancillary services around it. ore precisely, from a functional perspective, one could break up the thereum ecosystem into three partsnnore rotocol echnologiesnn consensus, irtual achine, ontracts, eys, lockchain, oftware anguages and evelopment nvironments, urrency (uel), echnology ntegration and iddleware ervices.nnpplicationsnnlient software (ist or lethero), ining, onitoring ervices, Ðpps and other third party pplications.nnncillary ervicesnnostly centered on ducation, esearch, earning and upport via wikis, forums, the th cademy, web sites, bounty incentives, and a future developers conference.nnf particular interest is the pplications segment whose size has already snowballed to over  various third-party projects, products, technology etensions and fully fledged businesses that are based on thereum either entirely or partially. hey include applications such as rediction arkets, ecentralized changes, rowdfunding, nternet of hings, oting and overnance, aming, eputation ystems, ocial etworking, hat essaging, nsurance, ealthcare, rts, idesharing, istributed utonomous rganizations, rading (financial instruments or commodities), ccounting, ommunities, eommerce, hysical ecurity, ile torage, wnership tamping, ontent, icrotransactions, ommunity anagement, loud omputing, emittances, mart ontracts anagement, mart ssets, allets, ood, anufacturing, ata torage, essaging, upply hain and others.nn( future blog post will cover in more details the whole thereum ecosystem, including the partner pieces).nnll these components point unequivocally to a healthy progression and growth of the thereum footprint into a variety of financial and non-financial industry segments. thereum’s programming capabilities offers vastly more power than that offered by itcoin scripting because of the added powers of uring-completeness, value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state transition logic capabilities.nnhy hould usiness eople arennthereum’s technology was built for developers primarily. ut just like nformation echnology, thereum is an enabler of business opportunities, and as much as its initial support is vastly driven by a community of technologists, thereum’s impact will get multiplied once business professionals also understand the potential of decentralizing applications, along with processes they enable.nne need to learn how to apply what the blockchain technology gives us. thereum developers and technology enthusiasts acknowledge that what they see is not enough in order to reveal the entire spectrum of the applications potential. evelopers need business people as partners who understand thereum’s capabilities, and are willing to apply their own eperience towards that understanding.nnuring the 's, the corporate reengineering trend caught on. t was driven by a desire to abolish old processes that offered little value, and replace them by simplified ones. uddenly, every large organization was reviewing their business processes, and identifying the ones that were slow, centralized, epensive, archaic, or did not meet users and customers needs.nnithin the vision of thereum, lies a reengineering promise parallel.nnhe outcome would be to embark on a similar “crash and burn” eercise to find old applications that are slow, epensive, archaic or not meeting the required needs, and figure out if they could be re-thought via Ðpps or truly decentralized applications.nnusiness people must learn about decentralization, and ask if old processes can be replaced by decentralized ones, enabled by thereum. f specific interest are the types of applications that previously relied on central intermediaries or gatekeepers that held final authority on trust-related processes. thereum enables the unbundling of trust, and repurposes it to run on the network.nnnce you understand how to unbundle central processes, and relegate them to the edges of the network, you are only bound by the limits of your imagination. ow is the time to shoot yourself in the foot, as it’s better than to have someone else shoot you in the head, tomorrow.nnrogressive business and  managers should identify technical resources on their teams that need to learn about thereum, and fund projects and implementations that promote innovation and reengineering efforts to discover and unlock the full potential of decentralized applications.nnf you fall in one of these categories, you are in an ecellent position to start diving into thereumnnisting  departmentsnntartups with new ideasnnorward-thinking developersnnurrent itcoin enthusiastsnnusiness innovators, leaders, investors and visionariesnns, activists, researchers, and policy makersnnhe best starting point for learning about developing on thereum is thennthereum ikinn.nnhat can you do with thereumnnthereum enables innovation via decentralized applications, equally touching industry, government and society segments.nnt is important to understand where decentralization and blockchains make the most sense, because we shouldn’t push those concepts on everything.nnrom a technology point of view, decentralization is particularly valuable for "base layer" services, i.e. what everything else relies on, such as identity, reputation, communications, social networks, markets, and making them work without relying on specific trusted intermediaries in the middle. rom a software applications perspective, blockchains are useful for enforcing decentralized consensus on databases that update themselves according to order-dependent state transition functions (where the speed of updates greater than one minute is acceptable), and this is where the network for powering thereum-based smart contracts can shine. hese can be used to securely eecute a wide variety of services including voting systems, domain name registries, financial echanges, crowdfunding platforms, company governance, self-enforcing agreements, intellectual property, smart property, and distributed autonomous organizations.nnart of the thereum vision is similar to itcoin’s in terms of enabling decentralization, but the devil is in the implementation details.nnhe thereum platform has been designed from the ground-up to enable decentralized applications, whereas itcoin’s genesis was a financial network that has been overloaded and overlaid with additional services and capabilities that are stretching its capabilities. rotocols "built on top" of itcoin are not light-client friendly, and the itcoin blockchain is simply not designed to be scalable enough to support every transaction for every possible use case.nnevelopers are choosing thereum because it’s easier to program advanced decentralized applications on thereum than on itcoin.nno think that itcoin’s blockchain can do all of what thereum is delivering is misinformed thinking.nnctually, a contrarian (but logical) view would be to think that itcoin needs thereum to succeed, because that increases the proof points and legitimacy for the viability of consensus-based applications development. thereum developers and partners are solving and implementing big issues in this space, and their success will inspire the global crypto-technology ecosystem in its entirety.nnevelopers decide with their code. uccess will come based on the merits of each application or business initiative. hether an application runs on itcoin or thereum is important during the development phase, but once in the marketplace, users decide by adopting and engaging with the best applications. o, if thereum development offers an advantage and you can eploit that, that's great.nnhe critical masses we need are ones of users, developers, investors, and innovators, not just miners.nnn the long term, both itcoin and thereum are going to be viable platforms, each attracting the types of applications that best fit the respective platform characteristics.nnonclusionnnnother way to view the cryptography field is in terms of itcoin pps and lockchain pps. thereum is squarely entrenched in the lockchain pps space which is a quite imaginative one. ts superiority shines via the implementation of advanced decentralized applications whereas itcoin’s blockchain has limitations, despite proposed overlay protocols, side chain projects and other itcoin improvement proposals.nno think that itcoin is the only needed cryptocurrency/blockchain implies a lack of understanding for the field of cryptography-based computer science which is the larger theme at play.nnhat would be like saying that ortran was the only language needed back in  when it was deployed by  who developed it, just because it enjoyed some success then as the first industrial high-level programming language. r, if homes were just invented, saying that building homes with wood from trees is the only way to build them. nd let’s not forget what ord said in  “ny customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.”nnany of the arguments for itcoin dominance are biased by self-fulfilling prophecies or wishful scenarios.nnhe cat is already out of the bag when it comes to innovation and adoption in alternative cryptocurrency protocols, and there is simply no real reason why itcoin is destined to succeed on its own, and that other alternative protocols would fail.nnitcoin and its blockchain don’t offer a silver bullet when it comes to decentralized applications development. here is hard work involved, but that work is a lot easier with thereum.nnhen you talk to developers, and see the level of activity around the thereum technology, you will quickly realize that thereum is spurring business and societal innovation at the global level, while opening the door to a new class of applications, never seen before. thereum is leading the pack in decentralized applications protocols because of the support and vibrancy of its community members who are being drawn by the superiority of its platform capabilities.nnut thereum is under no illusion that this won’t be a step-wise process, as it aims to gradually solve increasingly bigger problems, while starting with the more basic, simple and straight-forward ones.nnf itcoin has shown us the future of money, thereum is pointing to the future of decentralized software applications.nnf you are still not sure, ask your developer.nnilliam ougayarnnis a special advisor to th ev’s eecutive directors. is work in technology spans  years as a  entrepreneur, book
