catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhis following shows our current and planned epectations concerning maimum likely chain-reorganisation depth. e would not consider transactions within this depth to have an eceptionally high chance of being permanent. hese are our own epectations only andnndo not constitute any sort of guaranteenn. hey are derived from theoretical considerations, ongoing empirical data, human factors in contingency planning and the past eperience of our security team. s with all things in the peer-to-peer space the risk is entirely with the individual operator.nnn much the same way as many in the space, we will be monitoring the chain for any signs of protocol-level issues. f we have any reason to suspect that there is a protocol level issuennwe will update these epectationsnnaccordingly the updates will be posted in the forums and on the official blog. ll those who are interested in our epectations and recommendations would do well to keep themselves abreast of the blog.nnnnntil //  nnnnrom //  ,nnnn(appro  hours)nn( day)nnrom //  ,nnnn(appro  hours)nn( days)nnrom //  ,nnnn(appro  hours)nn(

network (one which could belong to you, me, an echange, a miner, whoever) realises that what itnnthoughtnnwas the canonical chain turned out not to be. hen this happens, the transactions in the latter part of its chain (i.e. the most recent transactions) are reverted and rather the transactions in the newer replacement are eecuted.nnith thereum having a short target block time of s, this actually happens naturally rather often. ecause it takes time for the blocks to percolate through the network, it's easy for different parts of the network to have a different final block (or two, or perhaps even three) in normal operation since the miners often come up with them at roughly the same time. his is what we might callnnephemeral forkingnn. ndeed, many of the ommers (né uncles) that you see innnthereum's network monitornnwere once assumed by some nodes to be the final block in canonical chain.nnhen a re-organisation happens, or put another way, when the network reaches a more global consensus that it had earlier and annforknnis resolved, the nodes that had the now out-dated chain "reorganise" their chain, throwing away the recent and no-longer canonical blocks. ransactions are reverted and others eecuted to get in line with the other path of the fork.nnransactions can be mutually eclusive, like cheques if

result in the reversion of one transaction and the eecution of another, mutually eclusive transaction. s such if you're going to do an irreversible action on the back of a transaction being in the chain, it's very important to know the risks regarding reorganisation.nnoughly speaking, the chances of a reorganisation occurring reduce substantially the farther from the end you get. hat is, the chance of a reorganisation happening that alters the final three blocks is much less than the chance of one that alters the final block alone. his is because the consensus algorithm is constantly striving to end up at a common agreement over what the chain is. s long as there isn't consensus (and thus potential for a reorganisation), it's not in a stable state and will sooner or later topple into agreement. e call the number of blocks affected by the reorganisation thenndepthnnof the reorganisation.nnn general reorganisations happen automatically and safely, however, anyone making real-world decisions based upon transactions on the chain needs to be aware of reorganisations happening and, most importantly, must make a judgement decision on how deep a transaction must get in the apparent chain before they decide it is thennfinalnnchain and not merely a temporary fork than will eventually be reverted and resolved. he decision of how deep to wait is, in itcoin terms, called thennnumber of confirmationsnn.nnur (somewhat large) epectations of possible reorganisation depth (which may very well inform confirmation numbers) come from the fact that the protocol is immature, that human factors are involved in any remedial action and that substantial amounts could be at stake. asically, it's the rontier. here are scenarios, especially those involving adversaries ("%" attackers) that we have devised in which we believe fairly large numbers are indeed warranted at this initial stage.nnltimately, of course, we can only advise and inform he risk on how many "confirmations" to wait (or not) as with that of all operational decisions, lies with you. elcome to freedom -)
