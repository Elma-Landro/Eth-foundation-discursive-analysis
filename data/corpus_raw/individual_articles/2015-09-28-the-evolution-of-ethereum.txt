catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nany of you know that the thereum platform grew out of the realization that blockchains can go far beyond currency, together with a frustration with the limitations of previous projects. he core idea was simple a blockchain with a built-in uring-complete programming language, allowing users to build any kind of applications on top.nnver time, the vision evolved and epanded. he blockchain remains a crucial centerpiece, but it is ultimately only part of a larger vision of “web .”nnas described by avin ood herenn a more secure, trustworthy and globally accessible internet for agreements, finance, auditing, tracking and simple websites and web applications that use decentralized technology to overcome some of the practical, political and technological inefficiencies of previous approaches. ogether with the thereum blockchain, we see an entire suite of internally and eternally developed, low-level and high-level protocols including olidity, hisper, , zero knowledge proof systems, account management systems, dedicated browsers and much more, all with the goal of providing a coherent vision of the internet as it should be.nnith such an ambitious vision, come some challenges. ight now, the thereum project is in a time of complicated transition. any of the difficult initial work - myself, avin,

a piece are welcome to try their best to collect. oday, we can all be proud that the thereum developer ecosystem has grown large enough to includennmajor banksnn, corporations, governments,nnover a hundred dappsnnand individuals and businesses in dozens of countries speaking dozens of languages.nnt the same time, however, there are some difficult challenges that remain some technical, some organizational, and some of almost every kind. he core of the problem is simple. p until fairly recently, almost all of the work that has been done on the thereum project has been done by subsidiaries of the foundation. n the future, however, although the foundation and its subsidiaries are going to continue to take on a strong and leading role, it will be the community that will gradually be the primary driver in making it succeed. his is true for several reasons, some unplanned and some positive.nnirst of all, it is indeed true that the foundation’s finances are limited, and a large part of this was the result of our failure to sell nearly as much of our  holdings as we were planning to before the price dropped tonnnnnnannsnnannrnnennsnnunnlnntnn,nnwnnennsnnunnfnnfnnennrnnenndnnrnnonnunngnnhnnlnnynn as a result, we suffered roughlynnnnnnannsnnannresnnunnltnn,nnwnnesnnunnffnnerenndnnronnugnnhnnlnnynnm in lost potential capital , and a hiring schedule that was meant to last over three years ended up lasting a little under two (although bolstered by a “second wind” from our  holdings).nnecond, the project’s needs have grown. ver the past twenty months, the project has grown from being a simple attempt to improve on astercoin by adding a programming language into an effort to push forward a powerful and epansive vision of "web ." that includes multiple technologies, some built by ourselves and some by others, and a comple software stack that integrates them all with one simple aim to make it as easy to build secure, globally accessible and trust-minimized decentralized applications as it is to build a website - and hopefully even easier.nnhe foundation and its subsidiaries alone simply do not have the manpower to push the entirety of this vision through to its ultimate completion, including proof-of-stake driven scalable blockchains, seamlessly integrated distributed hash tables, programming languages with formal verification systems backed by state-of-the-art theorem provers and dozens of categories of middleware, all by itself although the foundation and its subsidiaries can, and will, continue to be the primary driver of technology at the core, a highly community-driven model is necessary and essential, both to help the thereum ecosystem maimally grow and flourish and to establish thereum as a decentralized project which is ultimately owned by all of humanity, and not any one group.nnnd fortunately, the community has already stepped up. ust to give a few eamples, here are a few parts of the thereum ecosystem that the thereum oundation and its subsidiaries  have had nothing to do withnnugurnn a prediction market that has earned $. million in its recent

documenting the perils of building a blockchain-based casino with a bad random number generator, and ian oucai'snnongoing work on nnto make this situation better).nnctually, the thereum ecosystem is maturing nicely, and looks unrecognizable from what it was barely a year ago.nnn the inside, we have thereum oundation subsidiary developers buildingnnyet more block eplorersnnand other tools in their spare time, and some developers are already working on implementing thereum-based lightning networks, identity and reputation systems, and more. n the near future, there will be several more non-profit and for-profit entities emerging in and around the space, some with the involvement of thereum team members, and many with partial involvement from myself. he first of these to announce itself is thennaniang blockchain research institute and fund based in hanghainn(yes, this is the “major collaboration”  hinted on recently, and is also my much delayed answer to “nnhow did your hina trip gonn”), which includes (i) an agreement to purchase  , which hasnnalreadynnconcludednn, (ii) an upcoming conference in ctober, (iii) a non-profit blockchain research institute, and (iv) a $m blockchain venture-capital fund, all with emphasis on thereum development.  fully epect that within si months the thereum for-profit ecosystem may well be much more well-capitalized than the oundation itself.nnote that a substantial number of thereum foundation subsidiary staff is going to be moving over to the rapidly growing for-profit thereum ecosystem over the net half year in order to bring more funds, interest and development effort into thereum-land so far, everyone  have talked to who is leaving the foundation subsidiaries is intending to do this, and they will in many cases simply be continuing, and epanding, the same work that they have started on now either under foundation subsidiary employment or as personal side projects, under a different banner.nning hannn, who has recently joined the foundation, will be managing the foundation’s administrative matters, helping to develop an updated and more detailed strategic plan, oversee con  setup, and generally make sure that things on the foundation side work smoothly throughout the many simultaneous transitions that are taking place we have also epanded our advisory board, and the new advisors will be announced soon.nnnder these circumstances, we must thus ask, what is the oundation going to do (and not do)nninancesnnet us start off by providing an overview of the oundation's financial situation. ts current holdings are roughlynn, nn, nn,, nnlus a ,  legal fund that will be reserved to cover possible legal defense (it’s like insurance). he foundation's monthly ependitures are currently ~,  and starting ct  are projected to fall to ,  a mid-term goal has been placed of , - ,  as a good target that allows us to deliver on our remaining, but important responsibilities. ssuming that we get there in three months and that ether and bitcoin prices stay the same (heh), we have enough to last until roughly un  at the , rate, and perhaps up to ep-ec  given planned transitions by that point, the intent is for the foundation to secure alternative revenue sources.nnossible revenue sources past that point includenneveloper workshops (including etended in-person “courses”)nnonference tickets and sponsorshipsnnhird-party donations and grants (whether to the oundation or to projects that the oundation would otherwise be spending resources on)nnnother action that may be taken is, when thereum switches to proof of stake, keeping % of the old issuance rate active for a year and directing the issuance into some kind of mechanism, perhaps a simple voting scheme or perhaps something more comple incorporating delegated voting, decision markets and potentially other revealed-preference tricks from game theory, in order to pay developers. n any case, our original promise that the issuance rate will not eceed .% per year, and the goal that the eventual final issuance will be much lower (likely -% per year) with proof of stake, will both be kept. e highly welcome community input on whether and how to go down this path if there is large opposition we will not do this, though the community should understand that  doing this comes with a risk of greater reliance on the for-profit ethereum ecosystem.nnocusnnp until perhaps si months ago, the oundation and its subsidiaries have been doing almost everything in the ecosystem right now, the foundation and its subsidiaries are still doing much of everything though some community members have stepped up to compete with its own offerings - in some cases, in my own humble opinion, quite ecellently. oing forward, the oundation and its subsidiaries will aim for a more focused approach where it carries out only some of the work in the ecosystem, but does it well. n approimate outline of the oundation's activities can be described as followsnnducationnnnline documentation and developer resources (new documentation site coming soon!)nnonferences (nncon nncoming in ovember!)nnackathons, workshopsnnossibly paid in-person development coursesnnonferences, events, eetups co-ordinationnnutreach, marketing and evangelism, both to the media/public and to institutionsnnompliance and regulatory maintenancennertifying businesses,

verificationnnero-knowledge proof integrationnnfficial protocol and sub-protocol specificationsnnigher-level development tasks will in the medium term be done largely by for-profit entities, volunteers and other members of the community, although the oundation’s subsidiaries will continue to employ many of the developers in the short term.nnransparencynnhe thereum oundation would like to epress a renewed interest in being maimally transparent in its affairs to that end, we are publishing the information above, and as an initial trial in going further we are working withnnonsensysnnto use their (thereum) blockchain-based accounting software alanc to record all epenses relating to evcon .nnnother important aspect of transparency is more open and inclusive development to that end, we are making a renewed push to move conversations from kype to itter where they are more publicly visible (eg. you can check outnnthis roomnnright now) and members of the public can more easily participate. e are also evaluating the possibility of introducing a more formal and inclusive process for agreeing on protocol upgrades and welcome input from client developers on this. nd there are more announcements both from ourselves and others that will be following soon.nnn sum, despite the evidence of growing pains, the state of the thereum nation is good, its ecosystem is vibrant, and its future is bright.nns a oundation, we will continue to focus on promoting and supporting research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols and tools to the world that empower developers to produce net generation (d)apps, and together build a more globally accessible, more free and more trustworthy nternet.
