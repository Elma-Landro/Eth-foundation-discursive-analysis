Titre: Ethereum Partners with R3CEV on Lizardcoin, Bringing Together the Best of Centralized Finance and Blockchain Technology\nAuteur: Vitalik Buterin\nDate: April 1, 2016\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/04/01/ethereum-partners-with-r3cev-on-lizardcoin-bringing-together-the-best-of-centralized-finance-and-blockchain-technology\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe thereum oundation has announced that it will be working with the ew ork-based banking consortium  on creating a new blockchain-based cryptocurrency, izardcoin, which aims to showcase the benefits of blockchain technology as well as the consortium's ability to bring the technology to institutional clients and the regulation-loving masses by supplementing it with a healthy dose ofnncentralized controlnn.nnizardcoin aims to be a direct competitor to itcoin as a store-of-value, beating out itcoin's  million fied supply cap with a first-in-its-classnndeflationarynnmodel, starting with a maimum supply of . million and then further reducing the supply by .% every year. t does this by taking advantage of one of the greatest innovations of modern central banking negative interest rates. ll accounts are charged a holding fee of .% per year, of which .% will go to member banks to do whatever they damn well please.nnn order to use izardcoin, a user must first separately go through  verification processes with  out of  member banks. "hat way it's more decentralized," im rant eplains "even if an entire  banks all get co-opted by thennoa'uldnnduring the net lluminati cabal summit, the aliens will not be able to create an infinite number of new accounts, stop the system from functioning, or go through disjoint subsets of member banks to create multiple accounts for the same person". he mechanism has been approved by yzantine fault tolerance eperts ndrew iller and min un irer, although urkish prime minister ecep ayyip rdogan has declined to comment, claiming that it is grossly offensive for computer scientists to use a former name of stanbul to refer to actors that are compromised or malicious.nnaul andomer from  has spoken favorably about the project, saying "we at  have a team of two people building on izardcoin technology, and we hope that our willingness to include this platform in our portfolio of  internal research projects comprising almost every technology in every industry under the sun shows that his s uge™, and that we believe that izardcoin is definitely the future". ob nthere from  organ adds, "for too long banks have been threatened by decentralized technology. ow, we have a platform with which we can use the power of cryptocurrency not to disrupt our core business lines, but rather to entrench them, and ensure for ourselves a stream of revenue that will go forward forever, and better serve our truennlizard-headed mastersnn."nne are also in active talks with the epartment of omeland ecurity regarding developing a strategy for how izardcoin can be used to combat terrorism worldwide. e hope that the people standing behind us in the security line won't mind too much - after all, we are building the net generation revolutionary economy.nnhe izardcoin crowdsale* will start in two wooks, and ether and unicorns will be accepted as payment, at an echange rate of  unicorn  .  nn.nn anyone in the world will be able to participate, although they will need to go through the  process with  banks first, including multiple in-person visits in several countries we have partnered with oindesk to host blockchain conferences at each of these countries over the net  months, so that people can continue summitting while getting their approval stamps to purchase the summit of what blockchain technology has to offer.nn*he izardcoin crowdsale does not carry any legal guarantees or promises neither  nor thereum accept any responsibility for continuing development of the izardcoin platform once the crowdsale is completed. n fact, because thereum is a public blockchain and hencennlacks settlement finalitynn, neither ether nor unicorns nor izardcoin will ever actually change hands - it will only get eponentially probabilistically close to doing so for this reason, the izardcoin crowdsale in fact does not legally constitute an offering of any kind.
