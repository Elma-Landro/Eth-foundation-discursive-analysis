Titre: An Analysis of the First 100000 Blocks\nAuteur: Gustav Simonsson\nDate: on August 18, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/18/frontier-first-100k-blocks\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nfter a successful launch, rontier passed it's th block earlier this week. ere are some interesting stats from these first blocks.nnhe first  block times (in seconds)nnight after genesis, it took  seconds for the second block to appear, then  and  seconds for the net couple of blocks. ot too surprising as the miners scrambled with their setups as the final genesis block became known.nnfter these first blocks, we see the block time drop significantly at the onslaught of larger miners, flooring at  second that is the limit enforced by the consensus protocol.nnet's now look at the average block time (every th block from genesis to block )nne can see the hashing power really attacking the network after the first few hundred blocks, with block times at - seconds as the difficulty adjustment algorithm is catching up. his algorithm either increases or decreases the difficulty by diff/ each block, depending on the block time.nnfter a few thousand blocks, we see the difficulty going up enough for block times to get into the - second range. fter k blocks, we're starting to approach the target time of  seconds.nniggest miners in first k blocks (address, blocks, %) nnefeddfecadece    .%
