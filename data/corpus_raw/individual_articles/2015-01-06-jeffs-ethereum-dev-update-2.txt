Titre: Jeff’s Ethereum ÐΞV Update II\nAuteur: Jeffrey Wilcke\nDate: January 6, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/06/jeffs-ethereum-dev-update-2\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nirst of all,nnhappy new yearnn! hat a year it has been. ith a little luck we'll surpass last year with an even more awesome year. t's been too long since 've given an update on my side of things and that of the o team and mostly due to a lack of time. 've been so incredibly busy and so many things have happened these past  months 've hardly had time to sit down and assess it all.nns you may be well aware the audit is looming around the corner and my little baby (go-ethereum!) will undergo it's full inspection very, very soon. he audit teams will tear it apart and see if the repo contains anything incorrectly implemented as well as search for any major security flaws in the design and implementation. e've been pretty solid on tests, testing implementation details as well as consensus tests (thanks to hristoph) and will continue to add more tests over time. e'll see how they hold up during the audit (though 'm confident we'll be fine, it's still a little bit scary (-)nnevelopmentnno-nnhas been released now for a about a week and has been quite stable (and growing in size!). e're already hard at work to finalising o- which includes numerous small changesnndjusted block time back tonnsnn(wasnnsnn)nnp codennnnhas becomenn(  )nnand thereforenn  ( - )nne've added an additional pre-compiled contract at address  which returns the given input (acts like copy / memcpy)nnngoingnnnneli has been hard at work on our new  package which has now entered in to v. (o-) and will soon already undergo it's first upgrade for o-. eli has done an amazing job on the design of the package and it's a real pleasure to work with. uto-generated documentation can be found atnnoocnn.nnhispernn month or so back  finished the first draft ofnnhispernnfor the o implementation and it's now passing whisper messages nicely around the network and uses the  package mentioned earlier. he o  is relatively easy and requires almost zero setup.nnackendnnhe backend stack of ethereum has also received its first major (well deserved) overhaul. iktor's been incredibly hard at work to reimplement the download manager and the ethereum sub protocol.nnwarmnnince the first day ani joined the team he's passionately been working on thennpeer selection algorithmnnandnndistributed preimage archivenn. he  will be used for our warm tech. he spec is about % complete and roughly about % has been implemented. rogress is going strong!nnothnngo-ethereum/ppnnandnngo-ethereum/whispernnhave been developed in such a way that neither require ethereum to operate. f you're developing in o and your application requires a  network or (dark) messaging try out the packages. n eample sub protocol can be foundnnherennand an eample on how to use hisper can be foundnnherenn.nnms ubnnow that thennhubnnis finally set up you're free to drop by and grab a coffee with us. ou can find us in the rather posh neighbourhood of msterdam uid near useumplein (leander oerstraat ).nnn my net post  hope 'll have a release candidate for o- and perhaps even a draft implementation ofnnswarmnn. ut until then, happy whispering and mining!
