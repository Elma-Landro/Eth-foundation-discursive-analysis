to share some updates from the  team. e're always looking for more ways to support the ecosystem as it grows and evolves, so we've tried a couple of new things in recent months. ead on to learn more and see how you can get involved.nnffice oursnnarlier this month we ran our first office hours, with an open signup for teams or individuals to request a one-on-one call with the  team. e hope these will act as an efficient and accessible pathway to certain types of support such as high-level feedback, resource recommendations or guidance on applying for grants. ur first round of chats covered a wide variety of topics some people had questions about  or were trying to decide whether to apply for a grant, while others were looking for feedback on a particular aspect of their project or help figuring out the net steps in their thereum journey. e're looking forward to round two -nnsignups are open nownnfor calls taking place net week, arch -pril .nnocused rant oundsnnou may have seen the
