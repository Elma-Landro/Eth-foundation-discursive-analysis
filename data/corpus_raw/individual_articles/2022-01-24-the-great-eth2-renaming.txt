Titre: The great renaming: what happened to Eth2?\nAuteur: ethereum.org team\nDate: January 24, 2022\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nthereum is a protocol undergoing significant changes. lient teams are upgrading the protocol to scale to meet global demand while improving security and decentralization. eyond protocol development, a critical shift in thereum has been the movement away from ‘th’ and ‘th’ terminology.nns of late , core developers stopped using the terminologynn, preferring ‘eecution layer’ and ‘consensus layer’, respectively. oday, asnnhighlighted in our  roadmapnn,nnethereum.orgnnmakes the same shift.nnth → eecution layernnth → consensus layernnecution layer + consensus layer  thereumnnet’s eplore why.nnldrnnhe terms th and th (thereum .) are being phased outnnecution layer (th) and consensus layer (th) are the new terminologiesnnhe roadmap to scale thereum in a decentralized way remains the samennou don’t need to do anythingnnhere did thereum . come fromnnthereum always had, as part of its roadmap,nnplans to scale the network in a decentralized waynnand tonntransition to proof-of-stakenn. arly on, researchers worked on these efforts separately, but around  they werenncombined into a single roadmap under the “thereum .” umbrellann.nns part of that roadmap, the eisting proof-of-work chain (th) would eventually be deprecated via the difficulty bomb. sers & applications would migrate to a new, proof-of-stake thereum chain, known as th.nnhe articlennhe oadmap to erenitynnby onsenys eplains how things stood as of early .nnhat changednns work began on thenneacon hainnn, it became clear that the phased thereum . roadmap would take several years to deliver fully. his led to a revival of research initiatives on the proof-of-work chain such as tateless thereum, a paradigm that would remove the untouched state from the network to bound its growth rate.nnhe increased focus on making the proof-of-work chain long-term sustainable paired with the realization that the eacon hain would be ready much earlier than other components of the thereum . roadmap led to annn"arly erge" proposalnn. his proposal would launch the eisting  chain as "hard " of the thereum . system. ot only would this epedite the move to proof-of-stake, but it would also make for a much smoother transition for applications, as the move to proof-of-stake could happen without any migration on their end.nnhortly after this proposal, anny yan eplored how we could accomplish this by leveraging the eisting th clients in hisnnth+th client relationshipnnpost. his would massively reduce the development work required to deliver a post-merge system and leverage eisting clients, which had been battle-tested for years on ainnet. round the same time,nnresearch on rollupsnnas a viable and secure way to scale thereum proved promising. nstead of waiting on a comple, uncertain scaling solution years away, we could shift the focus towards scaling via rollups instead of sharded eecution.nnant to dive deeper heck out anny yan’snn“th + th  thereum” lobal presentationnn.nnhy can’t we just use thnnental modelsnnne major problem with the th branding is that it creates a broken mental model for new users of thereum. hey intuitively think that th comes first and th comes after. r that th ceases to eist once th eists. either of these is true. y removing th terminology, we save all future users from navigating this confusing mental model.nnnclusivitynns the roadmap for thereum has evolved, thereum . has become an inaccurate representation of thereum’s roadmap. eing careful and accurate in our word choice allows content on thereum to be understood by the broadest audience possible.nncam preventionnnnfortunately, malicious actors have attempted to use the th misnomer to scam users by telling them to swap their  for ‘’ tokens or that they must somehow migrate their  before the th upgrade.nne hope this updated terminology will bring clarity to eliminate this scam vector and help make the ecosystem safer.nntaking claritynnome staking operators have also represented  staked on the eacon hain with the ‘’ ticker. his creates potential confusion, given that users of these services are not actually receiving an ‘’ token. o ‘’ token eists it simply represents their share in that specific providers’ stake.nnow does this update change the thereum roadmapnnt doesn’t! t’s important to understand that this renaming represents a change in naming only. he features on thereum’s current roadmap (i.e.nnthe mergenn,nnshardingnn) and future features will still happen on the same timeline.nnore on the thereum upgradesnn.nnontent changesnnethereum.orgnnur ‘th’ resources (ethereum.org/en/eth) are now our ‘thereum upgrades’ sectionnnethereum.org/en/upgradesnnndividual features are now referred to as ‘upgrades’nnethereum.org/en/upgrades/beacon-chainnnethereum.org/en/upgrades/mergennethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chainsnnll pages previously discussing th have been updated, with eplanations included where appropriatennhe rebrand was a massive task with many content changes. here are likely instances we missed and improvements still to be made. otice something that needs fiingnnaise an issue or open a  on the ethereum.org itubnn.nntaking aunchpadnnpdate ebruary , nns part of the great renaming, we've also updated thennthereum taking aunchpadnn(formerly known as the th aunchpad) to reflect the terminology changes.nnlease raise an issue or create a  if we missed anythingnn.nnontent translationsnnf you’re capable of translating content, we could use your help! e’ve updated this content in nglish, but our + additional languages are now outdated and still reference th terminology. lease consider getting involved.nne’ve updated ournncontent bucketsnnto include an thereum upgrades bucket. his will empower our hundreds of active contributors to the ranslation rogram to directly target these changes to publish the new accurate information across languages more quickly.nnnterested in helping to translate ethereum.org or the thereum taking aunchpad heck outnnour translation programnn.nn final notenno many, ethereum.org is seen as a credible source of information maintained by our community. nderstandably, many didn’t want to shift away from th terminology until ethereum.org did. e hope that our changes will encourage others to move away from the outdated th terminology. y doing so, you will be helping to create consistency and clarity across the ecosystem, allowing for more accurate mental models and making thereum more accessible.nnpecial thanks tonnim eikonnandnnrent an ppsnnwhose writings were heavily referenced in this article.
