romnnannouncements about eventsnn, tonngrant wavesnn,nnprotocol upgradesnn, regularnnupdates from specific teamsnnor discussing thereum's vision and roadmap, the blog has been a helpful resource for those looking to stay in the loop.nnowever, there's been one big problem despite our global thereum community, this information has primarily only been available in nglish. ccessing this information is a challenge for the billions of non-nglish speakers around the world.nnethereum.org and the ranslation rogramnne've already seen ethereum.org demonstrate a successful, community-drivennnmodel for thereum translationsnn. n , ethereum.org began translating its educational, open-source content into multiple languages. ver time, this effort has scaled tonn languages availablennand millions of words translated each year by thousands of volunteer contributors.nnommunity engagementnn vital component of the ranslation rogram's success is itsnnthousands of enthusiastic contributorsnn. or many, translating is one of the most meaningful ways they can contribute to the thereum ecosystem in order to learn, teach, and give back to the community.nnthereum.org currently hasnn, contributing translatorsnn languages live on sitenn. million words translated in nn. million words translated in  so farnnre people using the translationsnnhe ethereum.org team's eperiment with translations sheds light on the value of making thereum content available in multiple languages. he takeaway has been clear the more content that we translate, the greater the percentage of overall traffic goes to translated pages. he trend has been steady, with translated content driving % of pageviews in late  to now comprising % of total pageviews. his makes intuitive sense—even community members proficient in nglish self-report preferring reading in their native language.nnhe most complete translation of the ethereum.org content is in hinese implified. he result % of all traffic to ethereum.org is to thennhinese implified version of the websitenn.nnranslate all the things!nns the success of translations on ethereum.org became apparent, other clear opportunities for translation arose.nnhennthereum taking aunchpadnn, an interactive guide to become a solo staker and set up a validator, has beennntranslated into  languagesnn.nnince early , we have also added some translations to select blog posts (e.g.nnrecentnntestnetnnupgradesnn). owever, these were a suboptimal, temporary solution given the blog didn't natively support internationalization. ranslations weren't easily indeable, searchable, or intuitive to find.nnlog updates what has changednnelow is a quick round-up of the work we've done so far and what we plan to improve net.nnnternationalization supportnns of today's launch, the  blog has full internationalization support, meaning when younnpick a languagennto view the blog (e.g.nnblog.ethereum.org/zhnn), you will be able to view all posts in your target language. his update

likennrabicnn.nnerformance improvementsnns part of the blog rebuild, we migrated the code to an entirely new tech stack (fromnnekyllnntonnet.jsnn). et.js is a modern web framework optimized for end-user performance. e epect performance upgrades to be noticeable by everyone, but those without access to high-speed internet should see the most significant improvements in loading speeds and user eperience.nnccessibility improvementsnnhis rebuild also improves general accessibility of the blog by providing better eperience with screen readers, improved keyboard navigation, and some colors updates to increase the contrast. hese improvements are largely thanks to our  library,nnhakrann, which adheres closely tonneb ontent ccessibility uidelines ()nn—shout out to their team of open source
