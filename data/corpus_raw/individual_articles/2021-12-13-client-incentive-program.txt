Titre: Announcing the Client Incentive Program\nAuteur: Ethereum Foundation Team\nDate: Team on December 13, 2021\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/13/client-incentive-program\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\note this post was updated on pril ,  to include a full copy of the lient ncentive rogram details.nn diverse set of clients is key to the thereum network's health and decentralization. iversity ensures that innovation continues at the base layer of the protocol, that the network is resilient in the face of potential attacks or bugs, and that a broad set of participants are engaged in debating potential changes to core protocol.nnhile clients provide an essential service to the network (without them, there is no network!), it has historically been difficult for them to capture value. ecently, more avenues have become available for these teams to build sustainable businesses, but most of those focus on mainnet-adjacent opportunities rather than the main thereum network. dditionally, these opportunities generally do not scale proportionally to the amount of value created.nno ensure that client teams have a strong incentive to maintain the core thereum network over the long term, the thereum oundation has launched a lient ncentive rogram. his program offers client teams -denominated rewards which unlock over time, as long as they continue to build software which meets the performance and security requirements of mainnet.nnpecifically, teams in the program will receive a total of  validators ( ) each to operate on mainnet. he size of these grants recognizes both the ecellent work performed over the past few years and the many development challenges epected well into the future. ne team, whose client is more recently mainnet compatible than their peers, has been included in the program with a % stake. he teams eligible for the program are, alphabeticallynnrigonnno-ethereum (geth)nnyperledger esunnighthousennodestar (% stake)nnethermindnnimbusnnrysmnnekunnhe validator deposits are made up-front to be operated by teams immediately, while the withdrawal credentials (the ownership of the funds) will be vested over several years, with the first tranche unlocked at the delivery of eacon hain withdrawals. n order to receive this and subsequent tranches of validator withdrawal credentials, teams must continue to maintain their clients, meet performance benchmarks on mainnet, and generally contribute toward delivering the thereum community's roadmap, as it evolves over time. fter he erge, client teams will also receive transactionm fees collected by their validators. his, along with staking rewards, will begin to provide a steady source of revenue to teams.nns the grants vest, teams are free to do what they please with the validators they control – e.g. continue to stake and earn rewards, withdraw and liquidate, or some combination of the two. lso note, the lient ncentive rogram is in addition to any grants that the  provides to these teams.nn full copy of the program's details has been included as an appendi below.nneth’s participation in this program is unique, since they are a team housed within the thereum oundation. owever, the eth team - like the other clients listed above - will have complete discretion over how to use these validators, earned fees, and their  deposits as the grants vest.nnhe structure of the program aligns teams with the long term health of the network and ensures they are incentivized to build secure and performant software. t was designed to be backwards-looking and reward teams who have already delivered production-quality software. e hope that it provides a foundation for a healthy incentivization of core contributors to thereum. s always, thenncosystem upport rogramnnis available, and eager, to fund earlier innovative thereum implementation efforts including new client teams.nne are ecited to finally share this initiative publicly, and we look forward to seeing more ways for the community to come together and support public goods!nnlient ncentive rogram etailsnniven the aggregate total of  that is planned to be distributed to client teams (about ,  when considering validator rewards, or, as of pril , , over $ in value), we recognize the community's interest in learning more about how distributions will take place, and how milestones will be met.nnhe full details of the incentive program, as shared with client teams, are below.nnrogram oals & ligibilitynnhe program aims to provide long-term support and incentives for teams towards maintaining reliable clients and a healthy network overall.nnor client teams to be eligible, they should already be contributing to the general development of thereum and intend to support the upcoming transition to proof of stake. hroughout the program, teams will need to maintain certain levels of performance to be eligible for the rewards.

validators can be assessed simply by viewing chain metrics, but additional node performance metrics might be requested.nn. elease sets of withdrawal credentials upon meeting milestonesnnaves of validators are to be released to the lient upon meeting pre-defined milestones via the transfer of the underlying privkeys for the validator withdrawal credentials.nnhen a wave of validators is

withdrawals from the beacon chain are enabled, with a minimum period of one year between the launch of the lient ncentive rogram () and the complete release of the first wave of credentials.nnf withdrawals from the beacon chain are enabled within or before the first year of the , the first wave of credentials will be released monthly, in equal tranches, from the first month after withdrawals are enabled, to the one year mark of the program. or eample, if withdrawals are enabled  months after the start of the program, then /th of the first tranche will be released on months , , , , ,  and

eceptional scenarios, the  will also take into account eogenous factors outside of the lient’s control.nnotenn n the contet of this plan, validator top-ups are against the rules and should generally be avoided. f in some scenario a top-up would benefit the health of the network, the  and client can discuss and reformulate the metrics/milestones accordingly.nnrobationnnf the lient drops below the success metrics, the lient’s incentivization status moves into probation. uring a probationary period the lient hasnn__nnepochs to get metrics back to successful standards, and during a probationary period the lient cannot have any validator credentials released. he amount of time spent in probation pushes back the release of any validator credentials by at least that amount of time.nnf lient

remedied, the  can at its sole discretion choose to place a maimum of  of the slashed  per slashed validator back into the program to be released at the final milestone.nnf the slashable event is eceedingly large, negligent, or repeated, the  can at their discretion partially or fully remove the lient from the incentivization program and partially or fully eit the lient’s validators.nnotenn erformance and canary validators arennbothnnsubject to the slashing rules.nnross-ayer ependenciesnnhile the lient is fully responsible to ensure that their operation is run in a performant and non-slashable way, we recognize that there is a limit to what eecution or consensus layer teams can do to mitigate issues on the other layer. pecifically, this means we epect the lient to adopt best practices with regards to running their nodes, but will not penalize them in the case of a widespread issue caused by the other layer. est practices when running validators includennnsuring that the lient can interoperate with most/all major clients, at least on canary validatorsnnnsuring that the lient's failures are decorrelated from the rest of the network, both by relying on diverse clients and hosting setupsnndeally ensuring that the lient's counterpart nodes are split across  client in case of a client-specific issuennnsuring that the lient has the ability to switch from one counterpart client to another in the case of a client-specific issue.nnermsnnhis plan is an opt-in additional incentivization plan for clients. articipation in this plan and the amount of locked funds available in the plan will have no bearing on future client grant decisions. lientsnncannninclude a small stipend for node infrastructure in grant requests regardless of participation.nnrerequisites of participation in this plan are successful participation in multi-client testnets and generally demonstrating production readiness at all times.nnn general and especially in the event of eceptional
