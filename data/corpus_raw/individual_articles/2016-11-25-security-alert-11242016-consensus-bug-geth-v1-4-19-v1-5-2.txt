Titre: Security alert [11/24/2016]: Consensus bug in geth v1.4.19 and v1.5.2\nAuteur: Vitalik Buterin\nDate: November 25, 2016\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/25/security-alert-11242016-consensus-bug-geth-v1-4-19-v1-5-2\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\necurity lertnnffected configurations ethnneverity ighnnummary  n issue has been identified with eth's journaling mechanism. his caused a network fork at block # (ov--  ). he new eth release .. fies the journaling issue and repairs the fork.nnetails eth was failing to revert empty account deletions when the transaction causing the deletions of empty accounts ended with an an out-of-gas eception. n additional issue was found in arity, where the arity client incorrectly failed to revert empty account deletions in a more limited set of contets involving out-of-gas calls to precompiled contracts the new eth behavior matches arity's, and empty accounts will cease to be a source of concern in general in about one week once the state clearing process finishes.nnhe chain that was created from block # by the old eth client, which both arity and the new eth release consider invalid, seems to have been mostly abandoned around block #, meaning that ~ blocks were mined on the now abandoned chain. ransactions are broadcast across the network so most transactions are likely present on both the old eth chain and the current chain, although mining rewards and transaction fees on the old eth chain are lost.nno transactions or blocks on the chain that both clients will now accept will be reverted.nnhe latest geth release will update the blockchain from the point of the fork, even if it has synced past the point of the fork.nnolution eth .. was released.nnf you are using eth ownload the latest client herennhttps//github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v..nnf you are using ist estart ist and the auto-update feature will prompt you to update the eth client that ist uses to geth ...nnf you do not update, please be aware you will be on an invalid chain that is not supported.nne continue to recommend that echanges and other high-value users run multiple clients and automatically halt operations or otherwise enter safe mode if they go out of sync by more than ~ blocks.nnthereum websites and mobile applications that allow you to store ether and/or make transactions are run by third party web based or mobile thereum providers ("hird arty roviders"). hird arty roviders run their own thereum client infrastructure to facilitate their services. enerally, you do not need to do anything if you use a hird arty rovider such as etaask, a, and ytherallet. owever, they may have instructions for you. ou should check with your thereum hird arty rovider to see what actions, if any, they are recommending for their users.nn-----------------------------nnnnhis is an emergent and evolving highly technical space. f you choose to participate, you should know there are many risks involved including but not limited to risks like unepected bugs and other technical complications that could result in loss of ether and other consequences. n addition, if you do not update to eth .., you will be on an unsupported network. y choosing to use the thereum platform, you assume the risks of this emergent platform.
