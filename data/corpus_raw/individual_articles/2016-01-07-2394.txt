Titre: Ethereum Foundation Internal Update\nAuteur: Vitalik Buterin\nDate: January 7, 2016\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/01/07/2394\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\now that thereum has launched and is rapidly nearing its omestead phase, over the last few months we at the thereum oundation have finally had the chance to have some breathing room and plan our strategies with a more long-term view. rom a development perspective, we have now started in earnest thenndevelopmentnnofnnerenitynn, the net large overhaul of the thereum protocol that will include powerful software abstraction features, the asper consensus algorithm and hopefully some basic scaffolding that will allow for the development of scalability features over time with minimal disruption.  has been released, and  will likely be released in about one month. n parallel to this, artin ecze is actively eploring options for optimizing the  using ebssembly, and several groups are working on implementing various forms of advanced cryptography on top of the  today.nns eciting as this work is, however, there are also substantial amount of equally important, even if somewhat less glamorous, work that needs to be done on the backend of the backend, in the thereum oundation itself, in order to make sure that the organization can survive and ideally prosper long enough to implement the full etent of the thereum vision.nnt the time of thennlast major update of this kindnn, the oundation’s primary challenges were organizational and financial. penses were very high, peaking at over ,  per month being spent on a combination of development, communications, administration and security audits. he ecosystem was rapidly blossoming, with a number of thereum-based companies either uncloaking themselves after months of quiet development or newly entering the scene - a saving grace for the oundation, as it no longer needed to sponsor development of every layer of the ecosystem itself, but nevertheless a transition that needed to be managed, so as to make sure that all of the relevant stakeholders continue to be included in the development process. dministrative inefficiencies, including a total of si entities in four jurisdictions, compounded our problems, and at times it seemed as though there was too much to handle.nnt was at this point that we, under the leadership of our new eecutive director ing han, began a process of streamlining our operations on multiple fronts, so as to prepare the oundation for its longer-term future.nnnd of one era, end of one set of challenges, start of an new era, start of another set...nnn the non-administrative front, perhaps the main highlight has been our efforts at increased transparency of the research and development process, the major initiatives on that front being the increased emphasis on usingnnour gitter channelsnnfor discussion rather than kype, as well as thenn processnnfor protocol upgrades both have been highly successful with a large portion of discussion happening on those channels and many s being made and discussed. e are also actively looking at the status of our other forms of internal and eternal communication and media, including forums, documentation and tutorials, and are actively welcoming community feedback regarding the best way to improve them.nnhe largest challenge of them all, however, was clearly financial. pen source projects are often known for being underfunded, sometimesnnwith very unfortunate resultsnn, and although the unique nature of public cryptoeconomic blockchains has and may continue to provide opportunities that are simply not available in most other circumstances, the problem remains, and we decided that before we are comfortable looking for ways to get more money we should first aim to be more efficient with the money that we already have. ence, it is here that the largest gains in the past four months have been made, and with very positive results.nnn the development side, we made the decision to take a more focused approach and primarily target the core thereum software and specifically the o client. his still includes much of the original thereum development plan, including light clients (which are well underway), a mobile wallet and ist, and we continue to support ++ and ython to a smaller etent with particular emphasis on the development tools (olidity and i), but other aspects of the ecosystem we are leaving to the wider community as awesome as the idea behind hisper is, it is currently getting zero oundation support - though we are actively looking for partnerships and other mechanisms that will help get some of these additions developed. ur communications has been greatly streamlined, and now consists of a smaller team of individuals who are part-time but more widely distributed around the world.nnome of the largest gains are in administrative costs. ver the past four months, we have started a process of consolidating the legal entities through which thereum development is financed by the oundation out of the si entities that we have had across urope through , three have now been essentially decommissioned and will soon begin the process of shutting down. e have also moved out of the house that we had rented when we epected to have a very large number of developers working full-time in ug, and are now based in a smaller location in the center of town that will save us an employee’s salary worth of monthly rent and utilities we have also closed our physical office in ondon and are actively eploring options for cutting rental costs in erlin. ith ing present much of the time in witzerland, we now have to rely much less on outside contractors for our needs there, allowing us to save even further.nnomebody else’s electricity bill now...nnll in all, the oundation’s monthly ependitures have now been reduced by over half from our  peak of over ,  per month, and currently stand at a monthly sum of about ,  (~, ). his roughly consists ofnn,  per month for ++ development (down by ~%)nn,  per month for o development (down by ~%)nn,  per month for ython development (down by ~%)nn,  per month for , hosting, maintaining build servers, release coordination, etc (down by ~% with more cuts likely coming soon)nn,  per month for communications (down by ~%)nn,  per month for research (roughly unchanged)nn,  per month for top-level administrative and eecutive staff, accounting, office management, legal and other epenses (down by ~% with more cuts likely coming soon)nnhe oundation’s current assets include roughly ,, ,   and $, in fiat currencies, giving us roughly one year of runway from this point assuming that both the ether price and our budgeting preferences remain unchanged. ome salaries are being paid in ether alongside this, we now also have an ongoing agreement with itcoin uisse to convert the oundation’s ether into fiat at the rate of ,  per day in order to secure ongoing liquidity (alongside ~$, worth of private sales to individuals and businesses). hese numbers reflect actual oundation holdings almost all ether from the genesis premine and the developer purchase program has by now been distributed to its rightful owners.nnver the net few months we epect optimizations and cost savings to continue, and as our overhead reduces we will begin once again ramping up our efforts on several fronts. e are soon adding isa heng to our team part-time for communications, and will also begin carefully increasing our ependitures on research efforts in order to speed up the development of erenity. t the same time, we are actively eploring various kinds of strategies in order to increase the oundation’s runway. iven the very large level of interest in thereum that we have seen in orth merica, urope and particularly sia, we are confident that we will be able to figure out an approach that ensures that development will continue not just past erenity, but also to a massively scalable thereum . and beyond.
