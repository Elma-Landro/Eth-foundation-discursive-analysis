https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/04/01/ecosystem-support-program-allocation-update\nCatÃ©gorie: Non catÃ©gorisÃ©\n\n==================================================\n\ns we embark on a new decade(!), the cosystem upport rogram team wanted to speak to some of the recent growth, transition and learning around the program, and share details of our  financial allocations.nnhat is nnhe cosystem upport rogram () is the arm of the thereum oundation focused on providing support to teams throughout the thereum ecosystem. his includes financial and non-financial support.  is an epansion of the rants program, which previously focused primarily on monetary support.nnmproving ur rocessesnnhe nnthereum oundation pring pdatennfirst previewed some of our plans for evolving from rants to . ince that transition, weâ€™ve continued to award straightforward grants, and helped make connections to other potential sources of funding where an  grant was not a fit. e have also facilitated advice from industry eperts, community eposure, access to cloud services and other infrastructure, and more.nnver the last nine months weâ€™ve incorporated feedback to refine our application process and made a number of changes, includingnn standardized process for reviewing  applicationsnnn epanded group of domain eperts available to help with peer review of applications, or to advise applicants on their projectsnnncreased focus on providing applicants with  feedbacknnorked more closely with accepted projects to create clearer goals, roadmaps, and mutual epectationsnnpanding ommunicationsnnith these stronger processes in place, weâ€™re making an effort to increase visibility and to attract more high-quality applications. o that end, weâ€™re making some changes to how we communicate, from improving eisting channels to adding some shiny new pages to thenn websitenn.nnome changes are modest, but we hope that theyâ€™ll be helpful in both keeping the community informed and better preparing potential applicants. n the front page you can now follow the latest news about  and see which events weâ€™ll be participating in, whether virtually or in person following the current and ongoing health crisis.nneâ€™ve added to our , improved our inquiry forms, and most importantly debuted some new page banners that we think really tie the room together ðŸ˜Ž. eep an eye out for even more additions in the coming months, and regular updates to eisting content!nneâ€™ve also added annishlistnnto bring attention to specific areas like security, th, and privacy, where weâ€™d like to see more applications. his list isnnnotnna declaration of what's important to the ecosystem, or even a statement of 's priorities. owever, we hope the list serves as inspiration for anyone looking to get involved! s always, we want to strike a balance between demonstrating the range of efforts that  supports while also embracing potential contributors working outside of the specific areas we've defined.nnn the reporting front, we will be publishing regular blog posts to announce new grant recipients, but a grant is only the beginning. oving forward, weâ€™ll also be highlighting what supported teams go on to accomplish. n the newnneatured rojectsnnpage, weâ€™ll spotlight projects that are months or years into the work that was enabled by those grants. eâ€™ll also use our blog and epand our use of social media to celebrate grant recipients as they achieve milestones and make progress toward their goals.nninancial upport in nnhile we worked to improve the cosystem upport rogram throughout , we continued to support projects across the ecosystem. warding grants is only one way that we provide that support. here are many amazing teams that arenâ€™t  grant recipients, either because theyâ€™re already funded or because their particular focus is just not the right fit for  funding. owever, we work to support these vital contributors in whatever way we can (for eample, as a bridge to new opportunities or as an amplifier of network effects for their projects).nnhat said, financial support continues to be a major part of how we support the broader thereum ecosystem. ver  projects received financial support in . hat is listed below details newly distributed grants to teams in . t does not include recurring support, tranches for newly achieved milestones from prior recipients, or funding for other  teams. or more details on all of the oundation's work, we'll share a  pring pdate in the coming days.nneâ€™re including names and summaries for each funded project
