Titre: The Xbox and Ethereum’s Dual Mandate\nAuteur: Joseph Lubin\nDate: May 15, 2014\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/15/the-xbox-and-ethereums-dual-mandate\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe ecessity to uild and aunch an cosystem on enesis aynnmagine if icrosoft released the bo and there were no games.nnn the day on which the thereum genesis block is created, many of the elements of the ecosystem — core infrastructure, mining network, user app browser and applications — will be in place.  ranted there will be an enormous amount of development to do beyond the genesis to craft thereum into a sophisticated, decentralized consensus (decentcon) application platform.  ut on day one, there will be “launch titles.”nnriginally, when the idea behind thereum was conceived in ovember, the intent was for it to be a simple “altcoin” (in fact, a meta-protocol on top of rimecoin) with a scripting language built in. ver time, however, as we realized the project’s potential our scope necessarily grew, and our current intent is to release a flagship product called the “therrowser” a browser that can browse both the old-school nternet and the decentralized web (nnebnn.nn).  rom the moment of inception of the thereum network, the following elements in the therrowser and the ecosystem will be operationalnna fully functional implementation of the thereum blockchain which enhances the itcoin technology with one-minute block times and stronger security (nn protocolnn), which decentralized applications (“Ðpps”) can use for anything that requires consensus (eg. currency and token systems, name registries, proof of eistence, etc., …)nna fully functional peer-to-peer protocol, which Ðpps can use to send messages between users. or eample, a decentralized messaging Ðpp will use this protocol for actual message sending, but the blockchain for registering user accounts.nnan elegant, browser-and-app-store user interface for using Ðppsnnnetwork nodes (miners) that process transactions and computations, secure the network through a consensus process and are compensated by fees and the issuance of new ethernna standard set of “built-in” utility-level Ðpps distributed wallet, distributed  system, distributed reputation system, distributed messaging system, distributed name registry service, distributed catalog of distributed applications, etc., will serve as just a few of the low-level utilities on the systemnna standard set of built-in tools for both developer and end-user blockchain eplorer, contract eplorer, transaction constructor, encrypted messaging tool, signature tool, authentication tool, ….  nd a debugger will be available for the hard core.nnnd soon after the genesis we hope to see a rich set of third-party distributed applications, e.g. distributed storage services, distributed notary services, distributed echange services, distributed escrow and arbitration services, financial contracts, insurance contracts, lending services, purposed reputation systems, games, entertainment services, etc., …  ach of the Ðpps in the different business verticals will be able to make use of the lower level, system utility Ðpps like the  and reputation systems.nnithout operational distributed applications, thereum is a hollow shell.  n order to have a broad offering of distributed applications from day one, non-profit, public-good elements must be built in conjunction with commercially driven applications in competitive markets.  rom this requirement, thereum takes its dual mandate.nnt can be argued that certain elements within an ecosystem should be developed for the common good, and do not benefit from a profit motive.  ertain other elements, are better developed in a competitive, for-profit contet.  or instance, it makes some sense to develop a coherent, large-scale, systematized road system for the public good, using public ta dollars.  ut it probably does not make sense to build cars with public ta dollars, since development under the pressures of free market competition forces the design and production of better products and benefits the market as a whole.nnual andate ollaborative on-rofit and or-rofit evelopmentnnwo hub organizations will lead the thereum roject under dual mandate a for-profit entity based in ug, witzerland, and a non-profit organization, based in oronto, anada.  oth of these organizations will be constructed in a fashion that will enable each to remain strong and financially independent to ensure years of development and growth of the ecosystem.nnhe thereum ecosystem will initially be constructed by the non-profit and for-profit entities in partnership, ideally with broad participation from many other independent entities.  he founding leadership will put into place mechanism that ensures that the foundational elements of the ecosystem are built and maintained in a fashion that adheres to the founding principles.  unding and independence will be guaranteed to the organizations (either state-registered businesses or eventually blockchain-registered businesses) that guide the various avenues of development of the core infrastructure.nnt the same time, human economies are largely about free market commerce (or should be), so the non-profit organization, to some etent — and especially the for-profit entity — will assist independent business efforts in the space to launch and flourish.  his assistance can take a variety of forms from providing resources and guidance, to maintaining support channels, to the creation of joint ventures.nnhe ybrid rganization odelnn“     -/-]  ,    ,   .    ]       ,              .nn“…   ,         , , ,       ,             .nn“ +  +

dual mandate approach and built thriving ecosystems and successful companies.  he model that un developed in the late s is also instructive.nnun icrosystems (now racle) developed the ava computer language and libraries in house. s innovative as it was, it is likely that it would not have acquired such large market share, had un not realized that they, as a for-profit company, could not control a foundational aspect of software development that it, and many of its competitors, were epected to use.  o address this conflict of interest, un open sourced ava and developed the ava ommunity rocess to shepherd growth of the platform in a nonpartisan fashion.nnthereum is an open source project and will remain open source.  nd the thereum roject, under the auspices of its non-profit foundation will create a community development process philosophically similar to the ava ommunity rocess.  n fact, thereum, thus far has been developed under a less formalized community development process.nnhe thereum non-profit entity will specify and guide the development of the core thereum infrastructure.  t will employ a non-partisan community development process and will develop, conduct and support research initiatives in the general cryptocurrency space.  he non-profit will have a membership composed originally of the thereum founders, and soon will add other independent leaders in the emerging space.nnhe thereum for-profit entity will be charged with the task of developing certain elements of the core infrastructure in collaboration with the non-profit entity and building out the cosystem with distributed application services and businesses that it develops itself, funds, or otherwise supports.nne believe this to be the most effective structure in the near term.  hat said, we are ists (wherennnnmeans istributed utonomous rganization).  e will look to move as much infrastructure and governance as soon as possible onto the blockchain.  ur penalary system will probably be the first component to move to the blockchain. lease stay tuned for more on the topics of penrganization and ification of the two organizations.  ur goal, if we do our jobs properly, is to put ourselves out of (state-registered) business.
