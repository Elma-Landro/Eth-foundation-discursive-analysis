Titre: The end of the beginning…\nAuteur: Gavin Wood\nDate: May 2, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/05/02/the-end-of-the-beginning\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\ns part of our tiered release process, we will soon be beginning the final phase prior to our rontier release. o far our ongoing roof-of-oncept  testnet has been running smoothly for around a month with dozens ofnnnodesnnaround the world, well over , blocks and including clients on several platforms and three different clean-room implementations. owever, that's not enough of a test for us.nnn a phase of the o- testnet called "lympic", the usage of this network will be incentivised through a collection of prizes (in ether, naturally!). e will give advice on what usage should maimise your chances of winning ether, though the precise judgement metrics will be withheld until prize time. uffice it to say, those in the employ of thereum or its subsidiaries will not be eligible.nnhe sorts of usage we will be awarding includennminingnnspending gas (in a variety of ways)nninteresting contracts (variety of opcodes, length of eecution time)nn... and of course a grand prize for causing a fork!nninay will keep you updated on this but our rough time scale for this isnnas soon as possiblenn)nnngoing work from my side...nns you might notice if you keep an eye on our repositories, development proceeds steadily. le (alongside eli on the o side) continue to perfect our peer-network infrastructure, with the last few changes having been prototyped recently and a period of review and testing to be carried out prior to our lympic binaries being released. arek's work (alongside abian on the o side) on the - testing and web.js continues to prepare the ground for rontier and lots of lovely Ðpps.nneanwhile, efteris has been refactoring our thash implementation, good for both ++ and o clients and helping make it as efficient and clean as possible. ann and rkadiy have been busy polishing i and getting the deployment eperience as smooth as possible, with the help of vsa, abian and utta. hristian and iana continue working on olidity, now putting in various optimisations and providing information for gas usage accounting in i. or my time coding, 've been doing mainly core refactoring and optimisation, getting the internals as smooth and reliable as possible, especially in block importing and transaction processing.nnaving largely completed the our test suite for consensus checking, hristoph now continues on his mammoth mission to get full test coverage through the ++ codebase, helped along by imitri. ne of our new starters, lad, will be helping out with pp networking and ultimately working his way towards hisper.nnor the past month or so, dward, our other new starter, has been working on our new developer-resources website for which  have big plans. ore on that closer the time of release.nnhat's it for now - watch this space for the announcement of lympic binaries and start figuring out how you'll be trying to win some of that ether!
