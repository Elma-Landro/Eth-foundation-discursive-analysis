completely refreshed evcon archive.nneet the new evcon rchivennevcon‚Äôs impact goes beyond just the physical event, and with that in mind, we‚Äôve completely revamped the evcon archive. hanges include an improved , better discoverability of content, reduced reliance on ouube, more decentralized content via , and community involvement in curation.nnhrough all of this, we hope evcon can continue to be an unparalleled educational resource to learn about the past, present, and future of the ecosystem. ead on to learn more about what‚Äôs new (and to try to earn a ), ornncheck out the site for yourself nownn.nn urated ontent ubnnased on preliminary user research with thennoriginalnnarchive implementation, users found it difficult to navigate the hundreds of evcon videos from each edition. ontent discoverability and guidance were lacking, and talks were provided with little to no contet or metadata.nnne common thread that we heard from the feedback sessions was that specific talks were instrumental in understanding critical concepts. eople re-visited those talks regularly through the archive, but only because they had been initially eposed to the session on the event schedule, or had actually attended the session.nnnd as much as the live sessions are core to the evcon eperience, the influ of parallel content makes it very difficult for attendees to participate in all the sessions that they wish to attend. or that reason, other people rely on video playbacks to catch up on the content after the event.nndditionally, curated content was repeatedly mentioned as a way to help epose users to new ideas and fresh perspectives that would have otherwise been largely ignored. ne of the most consistent positive pieces of feedback that we continuously receive related to the evcon in-person eperience is the serendipitous learning and ideas that the attendees eperience when they engage with content they had not previously planned on attending. e wanted to capitalize on this opportunity and allow the community to help craft this moment of delight through suggested playlists on niche areas of content epertise. f you are interested in helping with this, please check out thennoad to evcon uestnnahead for community curated playlists.nnaking ontent ore iscoverablennrom a user-perspective, our goal was to make the evcon archive be as easy as possible to navigate, filter, and access content based on your specific interest and skill level.nnhe new archive has been rebuilt from the ground up with a mobile-first implementation, allowing you to access your favorite thereum developer content on any device. ue to the comprehensive amount of metadata now available on the archive, you are able to search and filter videos with a variety of inputs. asily search content based on the speaker, talk descriptions, devcon tracks, keywords, level of epertise or the evcon event editions. ou can also access a wide array of curated and suggested playlists to help discover interesting and engaging content.nnote f you are a speaker featured on the evcon archive and would like to help improve the content description (or wish to edit your speaker biography) please

technologies that provide clear benefit to attendees and online participants.nnnternally, our reliance on centralized platforms was a concern, due to the risk of deplatforming and censorship of services and websites becoming more prevalent, we wanted to make sure that all the evcon content was censorship resistant, accessible globally, and persistent at all times for interested individuals to engage with.nnor this reason, we decided tonnfully integrate  as a part of the evcon archive eperiencenn.  is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and
