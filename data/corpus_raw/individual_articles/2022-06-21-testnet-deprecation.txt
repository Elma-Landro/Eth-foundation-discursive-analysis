thereum in a post-merge contet. fter he erge, inkebynnwill notnnbe a suitable testing environment for the thereum mainnet. nplanned mainnet upgrades may no longer be applied to deprecated testnets.nnthereum has many testnets for users and developers to test things on before interacting with mainnet. hese are effectively copies of the thereum mainnet on which ther and other tokens have no value. hey allow application, tooling, infrastructure and protocol developers to deploy changes to their products (or the protocol itself!) in a low stakes environment, before moving to mainnet.nnhat said, because testnets are full-featured blockchains, their history and state grow over time. his eventually makes them harder to run nodes on and to maintain. or this reason, some testnets are periodically sunsetted. his happened last year with thennyrmont eacon hain testnetnnand more recently with thennovan eecution layer testnetnn.nnith he erge approaching, client developers have decided to deprecate more testnets in order to focus their efforts on properly maintaining two of them over the long-termnnoerli and epoliann.nnhe iln, inkeby and opsten testnets are now being deprecated.nnestnet hutdown imelinennhile these three testnets are now considered deprecated, users and developers still have time to plan their migration before they are completely shut down. iln, opsten and inkeby will be shut down according to the schedule below.nniln fter ainnet ergennhe iln testnet, launched in  to provide a post-merge testing environment, will be shut down shortly after the thereum mainnet's transition to proof-of-stake, epected in the second half of .nnevelopersnnshould notnnuse iln as a long-lasting testing environment. t is epected to be the first testnet to be shut down after he erge happens on the thereum mainnet.nnopsten  nnhe opsten testnet, which ran throughnnhe erge on une , nn, will be shut down in  .nnevelopers who currently use opsten as a staging/testing environment should migrate to oerli or epolia.nninkeby / nnhe inkeby testnet willnnnotnnrun through he erge. t is being replaced by epolia, and will be shut down roughly one year after epolia has transitioned to proof-of-stake, around / .nnnce the thereum mainnet transitions to proof-of-stake, inkeby will no longer be an accurate staging environment for mainnet.  list of changes introduced by he erge that application developers should be aware of is availablennherenn. gain, note that these changes willnnnotnnbe deployed to inkeby.nnevelopers who currently use inkeby as a staging/testing environment should prioritize migrating to oerli or epolia, and projects who are affected by thereum's transition to proof-of-stake should aim to do so as soon as possible.nnoerli & epoliannhe two testnets which client developers will maintain post-merge are oerli and epolia.nnhe oerli network will merge with the rater eacon hain testnet.  new eacon hain has been created to transition epolia to proof-of-stake.nnoerli's eacon hain will remain open for users wanting to run a testnet validator. epolia will operate with a permissioned validator set, similarly to how some testnets work today. takers wanting to test protocol upgrades before they are deployed to mainnet should therefore use oerli.nnoerli also has a strong community and a lot of eisting infrastructure supporting it. ts state is the closest to mainnet, which can be useful for testing smart contract interactions.nnepolia, on the other hand, is fairly new, meaning its state and history are both quite small. his means the network is quick to sync to and that running a node on it requires less storage. his is useful for users who want to quickly spin up a node and interact with the network directly.nnummarynnn short, iln, opsten and inkeby are now deprecated. hile iln and opsten have already transitioned to proof-of-stake, inkeby willnnnotnnrun through this upgrade.nnfter he erge happens on mainnet, iln will be sunset. hen, by the end of the year, opsten will be as well. oughly one year after epolia has transitioned to proof-of-stake, around / , inkeby will be turned off.nnwo testnets, oerli and epolia, will be maintained going forward. oerli is recommended for stakers to test protocol upgrades and developers who want to interact with a large eisting state. epolia is recommended for users and developers who want a lighter weight chain to sync to and interact with.nno everyone who has helped run, maintain or support these networks, thank you!nneader photo bynnarl
