'll keep them coming at a regular clip after this one. th is looking good -- hase  is stable, client teams are crushing it, and some promising research was published for our stateless future.nntldrnnv..nnreleasednnas a stable target for multi-client testnetsnnelease ofnnombining  and aspernnpapernnfor public reviewnnolynomial commitmentsnnlooking promising for statelessnessnn bit ofnn  spec instabilitynn, but not further changes epectednnv..nnpost-audit releasennpec versionnnv..nn-- an partynn-- was released last week. his release represents a "post-audit" hase  spec, ready for long-standing multi-client testnets.nnt contains limited changes to the core consensus, instead with much of the focus on refining the network protocol -- e.g. cleaner sync protocol, o hardening, better network/chain separation, etc. heckout thennrelease notesnnfor more details.nnlients are working hard to incorporate these changes while continuing forward with stability, optimizations, and multi-client eperimentation. n fact, client teams are working through arch to lay the foundation for the coming multi-client testnets. oday -- eku syncs rysm, rysm syncs ighthouse, and most of the iscovery implementations can find eachother.nnelease ofnnombining  and aspernnpapernnhis week, we releasednnombining  and aspernnon arivnn. his work formalizes the core consensus components of eth -- asper  and - -- showing how they work together to form a safe and live system. his paper builds upon concepts initially presented in the originalnnasper the riendly inality adgetnnpapernn, layering them onto a more concrete roof-of-take, slot-based contet (i.e. that of the eth beacon chain).nnhis paper was created in parallel to the development of the hase  specs. t not only influenced the spec design but also highlighted some critical corner cases that had to be addressed. e are ecited to release it to the world for public consumption, comment, feedback, and critique.nnhis work spawned from ann"mini-spec"nnpresented by italik, but the lion's share of work was driven and completed by an . hang and his students at an ose tate niversity. e want to offer a special thanks to an and his students -- iego ernandez, hor amphefner, hiem ham, hi iao, uhyeok in, and ing ang -- for completing this critical milestone for eth.nnolynomial commitments promising for statelessnessnnitalik recently published an eciting ethresearch post,nnsing polynomial commitments to replace state rootsnn. his post proposes the utilization of polynomial commitments as a replacement to the traditional merkle-tree accumulator for blockchain state and data. f this research direction proves fruitful, we could reduce "witnesses" (i.e. proofs about the state required to process a block) from ~. to on the order of  to  k, solving one of the core issues in the tateless thereum research.nno state a bit more clearly -- thereum is pushing hard to move to a more "stateless" model (see the  researchnnand updatesnn. olynomial commitments could be the major breakthrough we've been looking for to make this statelessness a reality by significantly reducing the overhead of statelessness on block size.nnlthough incredibly promising, some of this research and magic math isnnvery newnn. e need to spend more time better understanding the compleities and tradeoffs, as well as just getting more eyes on this new and eciting technique.nn bit of   instabilitynnhe   standard recently incorporated a last minute change into the spec based upon eternal feedback concerning different applications and domains. he previousnnhash_to_basennwasnnnot friendlynnto embedded systems, applications requiring certain types of domain separation, and those utilizing - instead of -.nnn light ofnnthese concernsnn,nnhash_to_basennwas replaced with thennnew and improvednnhash_to_fieldnn. pec maintainers do not epect any more substantive changes to the spec, and this change is to be formally released as a "raft " soon.nns far as cryptographic standards go, we do not want to be in the position of eth with the eccak hash function -- that is, one of the only major applications using it. eing in a cryptographic island hinders the ease of cross-application interoperability as well as stifles the development of a wide set of robust implementations.nne are closely monitoring the development of the  standard, but in light of this recent change we are not rushing to deploy the mainnet deposit contract (which would in-effect lock us into a  spec) before there is a target eth launch date. e will continually evaluate the stability of the  standard going forward and do not epect this to become a bottleneck for launch.nnn other news, we will soon release a deposit interface and deploy a deposit contract for the coming long-standing multi-client testnet, but more on that net time ðŸš€.
