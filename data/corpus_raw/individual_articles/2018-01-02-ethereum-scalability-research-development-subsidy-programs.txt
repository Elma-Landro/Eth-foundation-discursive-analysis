community, key developers and researchers and others have always recognized scalability as perhaps the single most important key technical challenge that needs to be solved in order for blockchain applications to reach mass adoption. lockchain scalability is difficult primarily because a typical blockchain design requires every node in the network to process every transaction, which limits the transaction processing capacity of the entire system to the capacity of a single node.nnhere are two main paths to improving blockchain scalability. he first (“nnshardingnn”) involves creating better-designed base-layer blockchain protocols, which still maintain most of the desired decentralization and security properties of a blockchain that we see in the simple designs available today but only require a small percentage of nodes to see and process every transaction, allowing many more transactions to be processed in parallel at the same time. he second involves creating “layer ” protocols that send most transactions off-chain and only interact with the underlying blockchain in order to enter and eit from the layer- system and in the case of attacks on the system.nne view the two strategies as complementary with each other and we believe in supporting a multi-pronged strategy toward thereum scalability that engages both strategies and treats them as complementary with each other.nnechnical reading materials on thereum scalability technologiesnnhardingnnharding nnhttps//github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/harding-nn note on data availability and erasure

channelsnnhttp//www.jeffcoleman.ca/state-channels/nnaidennnhttps//raiden.network/.htmlnnith the thereum blockchain reaching  million transactions per day, and both thereum and other blockchain projects frequently reaching their full transaction capacity, the need for scaling progress is becoming more and more clear and urgent. o that end, in addition to ongoing and upcoming work that is happening on scalability internally, we are starting two eperimental subsidy schemes that we hope will empower more independent teams to collaborate with the thereum esearch team’s base-layer scalability research and development efforts as well as building independent layer- projects that can tie into and improve thereum’s scalability.nnndependent teams of developers, companies, and university and academic groups are all welcome to apply we recognize that different types of applicants may require different formats and processes and we are willing to be fleible to accommodate individual teams’ needs.nnharding client subsidy programnnver the last few months, development on sharding has picked up quickly.  specification for an initial prototype isnnclose to finalizednn, with a roadmap that allows it to be slowly introduced into thereum, first as a “loosely coupled” sidechain anchored into the thereum base chain through a “validator manager contract”, later introducing tighter and tighter integration with the thereum base chain over time.  reference implementation is being built in python on top ofnny-nn, and a testnet in python is not too far away.nnnd in this net step, we want you to be involved. e want the thereum sharding testnet, and later sharding mainnet, to be a multi-client ecosystem right from the start, with the thereum oundation not supporting any single privileged production implementation. he thereum oundation-funded research team will continue to build an implementation in python and possibly other languages, but this is intended as a reference and proof of concept first and foremost. hile we aim to continue to focus heavily on research and specification, we do not want to ultimately “win” the competition for which client gets the most actual users once the network goes live.nnnstead, the thereum oundation will be making subsidies available to independent groups in the community that want to help build an implementation and participate in the sharding testnets and mainnet. hese payments are  intended to be sources of substantial profit to recipient organizations they are rather intended to cover some of the costs involved, with the understanding that anyone who participates in the scheme will have access to a unique opportunity to participate in thereum . development, with close collaboration with core thereum researchers, and be part of the development of one of the first clients that will be available when the sharding mainnet goes live.nnhis will take the form of a specialized program, which will eist alongside more general grant program that the oundation will release soon. ubsidy amounts ofnnnn,nnnnunnpnntnnonn, up tonnnn,nnnnunnptnnonn,, will be available, and possibly more for highly successful projects the size of the subsidy will take into account the quality of the team, the scope of the proposed implementation, and the progress of the project over time. articipants will interact closely with the core research team, and will have a key role in shaping the final specification that gets developed over the course of implementing the spec and running the test networks.nnayer- scalability solution subsidy programnnhere has been a large number of independent proposals recently for how blockchains such as thereum can be scaled up through second-layer protocols. e recognize and appreciate that developers and researchers are ecited about researching and implementing technologies in this area, and that many teams want the freedom to conceive and build out their own design that incorporates their own ideas. e want to offer an opportunity for such teams to eercise their creativity and build out their scalable blockchain proposals, all while staying within the thereum family.nno that end, we are announcing a subsidy scheme for projects that are building scalability and latency-reducing “layer ” platforms that live on top of thereum, benefitting from the thereum blockchain’s security as a base layer and interoperability with the greater thereum community and platform.nnike the sharding client scheme, this will take the form of a specialized grant program, and subsidy amounts ofnnnn,nnnntnnonn, tonnnn,nnnntnnonn,, will be available depending on scope, scale and quality. he subsidy may be available even if the project has an independent business model, or funding from potential other sources in the thereum community, though we will prioritize funding projects that otherwise lack ability to sustain themselves, and it absolutely must be the case that the work funded is open source from end to end and provides a common good to the thereum ecosystem.nnargets for funding include efforts at developing high-quality implementations of eisting known layer- scaling strategies (eg. state channels, lasma), as well as researching and developing new ones.nnlosing notesnnoth of these programs are in a very early stage, and grants will be initially decided at the discretion of thereum core leadership. etails, including the terms, conditions and schedules under which payments will be made may change as the result of our initial eperience with program participants, and we epect the program to solidify and epand over the course of the year.nnote also that though the payments from these collaboration programs are much higher than those that we have made from our previous grant programs, these payments come with a much higher epectation of focus and quality. e are targeting skilled teams with either direct eperience in the thereum or blockchain space, or eperience in the broader fields of mechanism design, distributed systems or cryptography, as well as software engineering. he programs are also highly targeted at sharding clients and layer- scaling solutions this is  a general-purpose grant program. hat is still being developed, and details will be released as soon as they are ready.nnow to applynnhe first step is to send an email
