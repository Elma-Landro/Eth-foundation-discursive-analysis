Titre: DAO Wars: Your voice on the soft-fork dilemma\nAuteur: Péter Szilágyi\nDate: June 24, 2016\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/24/dao-wars-youre-voice-soft-fork-dilemma\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nhe last week was quite hectic for all of us in the thereum ecosystem. he  has shown us that it takes much more effort to write smart contracts than we originally anticipated but also that it takes a surprising amount of debate to reach a consensus on issues of this scale.nnverybody in our community was very vocal and forthcoming about how the problem should be fied in his/her opinion, or whether there's even a problem to fi in the first place. hile many have suggested an immediate hard-fork, the implications of such action are yet to be fully understood. n alternative suggestion was the creation of a soft-fork allowing miners to temporarily put certain transactions on hold, attempting to recover the funds without any invasive action on the thereum protocol itself.nns there is no clear, best course of action that will satisfy all community members equally, we've decided to give the power to the people running thereum to decide whether they support this decision or not.nno this end, we've releasednnversion .. of ethnn(codename " ars") as a small patch release to give the community a voice to decide whether to temporarily freeze hes v. from releasing funds or not. f the community decides to freeze the funds, only a few whitelisted accounts can retrieve the blocked funds and return them to previous owners.  similar mechanism is provided bynnversion .. of aritynntoo.nnote f the soft-fork passes, it will block all s from releasing funds, not just the ones the community considers attacked. his is understandably undesired for all legitimately split s. s such – if the community votes to enact the soft-fork – we propose a follow up patch to the soft-fork that will whitelist all s split according to the intent upheld by the enacted soft-fork.nnow to use this releasenniners supporting the  soft-fork can do so by startingnneth ..nnwithnn--dao-soft-forknn. his will cause the block gas limits to be lowered towards i million until the deciding blocknnnn(appro.  days from now) is reached. f the gas limit of this block is below or equal , the soft-fork goes into effect and (all updating) miners will start blocking  transactions that release funds.nniners not supporting the  soft-fork can run eth normally without any etra arguments needed. hey will try to keep the block gas limits at the current . million. f the gas limit of the decisive block will be above , the soft-fork is denied and (all updating) miners will accept  transactions that release funds.nnote ll updating clients will agree upon the outcome of the vote and will adhere to that decision. f the soft-fork vote passes, miners voting against it will start blocking transactions too whereas if the soft-fork is denied, miners voting for it will also accept all transactions.nnhat if  don't updatenniners who do not update by definition vote against the soft-fork as they will continue the current logic of keeping the gas limit above the vote threshold. f the soft-fork is accepted by the majority, non-updating miners will still accept blocked transactions. n that case, non-updating miners will either fork off their own thereum network, diverging from the majority, or will forfeit any blocks they mined (since it's not accepted by the majority, overruling the minority blocks).nnhould non-miners (nodes, wallets, mist, etc) updatennrom the perspective of non-miners, this update has little relevance. ither outcome of the vote is equally valid from a plain node's perspective, so plain nodes will accept the heavier chain miners decide on without having to know anything about the soft-fork mechanism or results.nnpiloguennhis releasennimplements annsoft-forknn.  soft-fork is perfectly compatible with all protocol rules and requires only the consensus of the majority of miners to enact. t is temporary and can be removed/amended at any point in time upon miner consensus. t does not break protocol rules it does not roll back any eecuted transactions/blocks and it does change not any blockchain state outside of the original protocol capabilities.nnote his release does not represent a consent to hard-fork the network. t is a means to give people more time to come up with the best solution.
