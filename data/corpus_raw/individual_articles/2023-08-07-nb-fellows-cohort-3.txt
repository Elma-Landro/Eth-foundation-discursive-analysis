https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/08/07/nb-fellows-cohort-3\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\ns we look at our world, it seems that individual humans are increasingly on the edges and in the margins of the big stories that play out on our scrolling screens. he narratives that captivate and resonate with ordinary folks seem to eist at a scale beyond the reach of any one of us -- hose big stories about economies, countries, and companies weave a narrative that can seem dire at times, or too big for an individual human to change in a meaningful way. ut this is not the true narrative of the world, nor is it the right way to understand our own potential as humans.nnany who read this blog are inclined to believe that the thereum protocol will play a role (maybe even a major one) in that big narrative in the sky. f that is so, then we should ask ourselves ho are the characters in our storynne seek to understand thereum through the lens of the individual humans that use it as a protocol for coordination.nny seeking out the contet and nuance of human stories, we can better orient ourselves toward a collective vision of the future, and better prepare ourselves to enact it.nnoday, we'd like to introduce five humans with stories to tell, who will be starting their et illion ellowship at the thereum oundation.nnhese individuals are highly qualified, but represent only a small slice of the capable people out there working to solve some of humanity's deepest coordination problems. e hope that their stories can serve as both a reflection of the true character of the thereum community-at-large, and an inspiration for how this open protocol might yet positively impact the lives of billions.nnellows ohort #nnriannnrian imiardinnbuilds

mechanisms, but sometimes ‘impact’ wanders into more subjective territory nvestigative journalism, for eample, is undoubtedly a public good. ow can the real work of journalists be documented and valued in a way that fits into the right funding mechanism evansh will work with citizen journalism newsrooms to eplore methodologies of impact documentation using thennhypercerts standardnn, with an aim to find a good mechanism of retroactive funding for positive social outcomes.nnasannasahiro “asa” ukuharannwants to spread the spirit of , (恩返し, "o return a favor") in the world of education.nn
