'm pleased to announce that r. ven hlert has joined us. e will be leading development operations cleaning up the build process, making the build as robust as possible, assisting aktu in our  systems and, most importantly, helping architect a stress-testing harness in which we'll be simulating a series of etreme situations, measuring and analysing. e's also a scrum aficionado and will be helping us streamline some of our development processes as our team grows.nnt is with great pleasure  can also announce that r. utta teiner will also be working closely with us in the capacity of managing our security audit. s well as being an enthusiastic Ðpp-developer, she comes with an ecellent track record of handling projects and a superb understanding of not only this cutting edge technology but also the human processes that must go on behind it.nn must also shout out to r. ndreas ubbe though a long-time member of the erlin thereum community and having worked on thereum-related code (a notable devotee of node.js), we have recently started working much more closely together on the secure thereum contract documentation (oc) framework and the associated natural language specification format, atpec.  look forward to some great collaboration.nnside from efteris, who began his first official day with us today (working with hristian on olidity, and more specifically on the oc and atpec portions of it), we have two new developers joining us ann evreau and rkadiy aronyan. ann, a recent arrival in erlin from his native rance will be joined by rkadiy who is travelling all the way from oscow to become part of the team. oth have substantial eperience in ++ and related technologies and will be helping us flesh out the developer tools and in particular pave the way to the  vision.nninally, 'm happy to report that hristoph entzsch, though originally joining us for only  months (while taking time out from his doctoral studies), will be joining the project full time in the new year and continuing his much appreciated work on our tests and the general ++ health and robustness.nnÐΞcon-nns time rushes by, arah, oland and their team rush even more to finish our hub. or they know that come onday the th, erlin will have some new arrivals. evelopers and collaborators from around the globe will descend on a aldemarstraße, erlin  for a week of getting everybody on the same page. t is con- ethereum's first developer symposium.nnonceived by myself and eff on a sleepy train from ug to urich as a means of getting the msterdam/o guys on the same page as the erlin/++ guys it has evolved into a showcase, set of seminars and workshops of all of ÐΞ, our technologies, our personnel and some of our close collaborators. t is a chance for us each to build lasting professional relationships and bond in what will become a project that may if not define, certainly form a hallmark, on our professional lifes.nnur hub will play host to around  people, the vast majority of which are accomplished technical minds that eff, myself or italik has at one point or another mentioned, and for the period of a week we will be chatting, mingling and sharing our ideas, hopes and dreams for everything blockchain, decentralised and disruption related. t's going to be awesome look out for the videos!nnver closernnside from the continuing work towards starting o- and the alpha series, 'm glad to report that the olidity project storms onwards under the stewardship of hristian the first contracts compiled with olidity have been delivered and tested working on the testnet, and as  write this  see another ull equest for state mappings. reat stuff.nnle has also been working tirelessly on our crypto code and is now beginning work on the pp layer, the full strategy for which we'll be seeing in his address at ÐΞcon. arek and arian have also been busy on the avascript , and  can assure any avascript Ðpp developers that they will have a lot to look forward to in o-.nnumming pnnhere are also a few other developments and personnel 'd love to announce, but  fear, once again, it will have to wait until net time. atch this space for a post-ÐΞcon update!nnav.
