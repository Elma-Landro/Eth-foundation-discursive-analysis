Titre: Announcing Beneficiaries of the Ethereum Foundation Grants\nAuteur: Ethereum Team\nDate: March 7, 2018\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/03/07/announcing-beneficiaries-ethereum-foundation-grants\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\ne’re ecited to share the results of the first wave of grants from the thereum oundation.nns a reminder, the thereum project seeks to support useful dapps and smart contracts on the thereum blockchain, and the goal of the thereum oundation is to empower developers with best-in-class &, developer eperience, and education. espite the early promise of the ecosystem, we still have a long way to go, and we are here to work with the community to drive concrete progress.nnhese grants will fuel the teams working hard at research & development to support the entire ecosystem. urthermore, we hope that these grants will signal to the community what we think are the missing pieces in the ecosystem that need more support. aid in another way, the oundation is here to serve teams and individuals that are working to prevent a tragedy of the commons.nnhis year, we will double down on working with the community to make thereum scalable, useful and secure. s such, although this grant program was announced two months ago as annstrictly scalability-focused programnn, we decided to broaden the support to projects that are doing great work acrossnnscalability, usefulness and securitynn. hese projects have no s, no token sales, and focus simply on building useful products and eperiences.nncalabilitynncan be in the form of implementing sharding, plasma or state channels with eisting teams or on your own. t can also be in the form of optimizing geth/parity or building alternate clients.nnsefulnessnnis for improving the developer eperience (e.g. static analyzers, linters, dev frameworks, mobile s, documentation, olidity/yper development) or eperimenting with new dapps that provide utility to the end user.nnecuritynncan range from auditing eisting contracts to providing tools that prevent error-prone programming patterns to contributing to alternative second-layer languages that focus on security.nne are also beginning tonnengage with the design communitynnto help solve product and  design problems. or eample, key management, thereum payments  and onboarding flows are all areas that need major improvement for mainstream adoption. e would like to fund more design studies, hire, and connect talented designers with eciting teams in the space.nnastly, we would like to remind ourselves of how the thereum project began passionatennopen-source developersnncontributing to the project on their spare time. n that spirit, we’ve begun a “hackternship” grant for community members that propose an impactful thereum side project.nnwardee istnnere are the inaugural thereum oundation grant winnersnn esearchnn– calability rant – $.. tate channels research.nnuntime erificationnn– ecurity rant – $. asper contract formal verification.nnlobalnn– ev rant* – $. orld-class developer conferences for thereumnnrysmatic absnn– calability rant – $. harding implementation.nnnn– #buidl rant** – $. okenless decentralized derivatives network + state channels &nnarcelona upercomputing enternn– calability rant – $. harding simulation.nnlasma aiwan evnn– calability rant – $. lasma implementation.nnthers.jsnn– ev rant – $. eb.js alternative.nnurbo ethnn– calability rant – $. eth optimization.nnoliumnn– ev rant – $. olidity static analyzer.nnle omarovnn– esign rant – $. ey management  studynn(nonymous)nn– ackternship – $. eterministic ebssembly.nnnkit ajnn– ackternship – $. echnical writing for eth and olidity.nn* ev rant – mproves developer eperience (“useful” for developers).nn** #buidl rant – uilds for the end user (“useful” for users).nnhat we provide for teams that win a grantnnon-dilutive fundingnnechnical advisorynnonnection to more usersnnlatform to share your worknne hope to provide thereum teams with more runway, advice and resources to focus simply on building useful products and eperiences.nnlso, many of these grants may be followed on with additional funding and/or collaboration when milestones are achieved. e believe this will provide tight feedback loops for impact to the ecosystem.nnishlist for future grantsnnn future rounds of grants, we would like to see more applications in these areasnncalabilitynnlternate sharding implementationsnnlternate plasma implementationsnnmproving efficiency of eisting clients such as geth & paritynn tokenless “ightning etwork” for thereumnnsefulnessnn design studies to improve private key management and transacting in thereumnnlternative wallet / client designsnnooling that improves developer eperiencennmproved documentation & developer/user education videosnnecuritynnecurity audits for olidity and ypernnmart contract auditsnnooling that prevents vulnerable codenn“ackternships”nnou have a job (or school) o problem!
