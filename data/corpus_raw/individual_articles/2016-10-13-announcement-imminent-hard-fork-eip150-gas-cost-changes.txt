Titre: Announcement of imminent hard fork for EIP150 gas cost changes\nAuteur: Martin Swende\nDate: October 13, 2016\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/10/13/announcement-imminent-hard-fork-eip150-gas-cost-changes\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nuring the last couple of weeks, the thereum network has been the target of a sustained attack. he attacker(s) have been very crafty in locating vulnerabilities in the client implementations as well as the protocol specification.nnhile the recent patches have led to an overall increased resiliency in the client implementations, the attacks have also demonstrated that a lower-level change to the  pricing model is needed.nnor many users, the most visible consequence is probably that they are having difficulties getting transactions included in blocks, and full nodes are facing memory limitations in managing the bloated state.nnhis is our strategy to address these issuesnns a temporary measure to minimize the effects of the most recent attack, we recommend all miners to lower the gaslimit to  gas.nn hard-fork based onnn  version cnnwill be put into effect at blocknnnnsee below]. his will reprice certain operations to correspond better to the underlying computational compleity.nn second hard-fork will follow shortly after, aimed at reverting the current "state-bloat" introduced by the attacks. his second fork will serve to remove accounts which are empty lacking code, balance, storage and nonce  .nne have implemented the changes required in the clients and are currently etending and adding tests in an effort to prevent the introduction of consensus-breaking vulnerabilities.nnnd as a reminder, thennthereum ug ountynnis open and includes the new hardfork-implementations.nn ork block has been moved tonnnnin order to accommodate even more testing.
