Titre: Ethereum Builders: Tapping Into The Collaborative Potential\nAuteur: Mihai Alisie\nDate: April 6, 2015\nURL: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/06/ethereum-builders-supercharging-github\nCatégorie: Non catégorisé\n\n==================================================\n\nello, fellow thereans.  amnnihai lisienn, one of the thereum founders, and for the past year ’ve served as the vice president of the thereum oundation and as director of thereum witzerland.nnuring the last few months ’ve been researching and testing a number of collaborative tools, constantly assessing the usefulness and applicability of each tool in the contet of our community.nnhynnecause  think there is a lot of untapped potential in this community, and  think part of the reason that potential is untapped is the lack of a streamlined collaboration system.nnhis article is a continuation of the proposed eperiment post, epanding on a few of the core ideas while eploring the ethereum.builders collaboration system used as a project. owards the end of the article you'll also find a few project updates and a couple of suggestions on how we can re-energize things and collaborate better, as a community.nnopefully some of you will find this useful or maybe even take it further, as  think that improving collaboration at the community level is an important goal worthy of time and commitment.nns always, feedback, help and comments are more than welcome.nnhe nitial periment  ollaboration atalystnn"lone we can do so little, together we can do so much." —elen ellernne all want to do awesome things, and we need to make it as easy to collaborate as possible so that people can focus on their ideas, rather than having to worry about being invited into a kype room just to be able to coordinate with others working on similar ideas.nnellow is a reddit post that sums it up nicelynnrom the design stage, thereum uilders was envisioned as a tool that would lower the entry barriers, increase the community member interaction and bring the fun of working together closer to everyone.nnesides, with an actively engaged community, the ongoing feedback given by the group can also help the developer team test and improve features while including new people in various aspects of thereum as a project.nnow, with thereum uilders you have people talking about their work, sharing knowledge, and providing peer-to-peer support, all of which also allows new developers to come on board and be up and running quickly and successfully.nnegarding the future thereum sessions, ’d like to remind everyone thatnnanyonenncan schedule a session. hat meansnnanyone reallynnwith a project or an interesting topic can propose a time, and if people consider the project and/or topic attractive,nnthe rest will take care of itself.nnince soft-launched on arch th, thereum uilders has now over  members that share knowledge and collaborate openly.nnwesome!nnhe first session was a much-needednnthereum client install festnn, followed by an introduction in thennthereum  projectnn, annlounge sessionnnwith ecentral ancouver and spiking up with the awesomennroject roundhog presentation and brainstorming sessionnn.nne also have a few cool sessions coming up, such as thenn“ultimate stablecoin built on thereum” (eollar) scheduled for pril thnnto blockchain based prediction markets built on thereum (ugur, date not set yet). he sessions are open for anyone, so if you find any of these topics interesting,nnjoin innnornncreate one yourselfnnif you’d like to propose a topic!nnow, in order to manage this project, we use a cocktail of collaboration tools and since it has been received well by quite a few people already, ’d like to share it with you too. f you find this useful and need some help in getting it up and running or want to say thank-you,nnget in touch with usnn.nnicking t p a otch itub owered ollaboration rameworknn"alent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships." —ichael ordannnfter eploring a vast number of options,  was convinced that co-opting the eistent infrastructure (i.e. itub) and repurposing it (i.e. enub) is the best combo for our needs, taking also considerable less time to deploy as an initial eperiment.nnn the current form, this is how things were thoughtnntep one upercharge itub workflowsnnere’s how we transform your usual itub account into a powerful project management toolnno to https//www.zenhub.io/ or directly install thennhrome etension from the webstorennonnect your itub account with enub.nnou can check if everything went okay by checking your itub application settings. ou should see enub as one of the authorized applications.nnf enub has been correctly installed, then a new tab called "board(s)" should appear on your itub repo pages. he board(s) are populated by the issues created, each new issue becoming a card on the new enub board tab.nnhis is how a populated board should looknntep two nhance itub interactivity with itternnesides itub, we also use an application called itter. ery straightforward setup

with ountysourcennne of the biggest problems surrounding open-source, community-based projects is resource starvation. n our case we'll ountysource to get around the resource-starvation issue and allow the community to guide itself and become self-sustainable in the process.nnnd here’s how ountysource fits into the picturennign innnwith your itub accountnnreate, contribute or solve the current issues listed in the thereum repos (and not only).nnhe cool part about it is that once integrated, it automatically updates the itub issues (itle, ody, abel), which is great since we're using enub and the itter activity panel. elow you can see an automatically updated issue that had a bounty created via ountysource.nnnd this is how it looks integrated with itter via the activity panel on the rightnnou're fully set up now to chat openly with other people about thereum (in multiple languages), contribute to all the eistent issues and also create new bounties. hings will get more interesting once we have the possibility of creating a  and/or , but in the meantime,  think this is a pretty cool solution as well.nnor those who are curious, you can see the components in action for thennΞ

worth mentioning that the guide has also been recommended as the # read selection from the universe of books published through itook via their weekly newsletter. ay!nne’re also in the process of converting ethereum.builders in a multilingual knowledge-sharing network. e started withnnhinesenn,nnpanishnn,nnussiannn,nnermannnandnntaliannn. epending on the results, we are planning to add more languages and see where it goes from there.nne’re doing this in order to activate localized learning and tap into the potential eistent in the meetups currently based innnmore than  countriesnn. ince the sessions are held by people from the community for the community, the focus shifts to enabling the local thereans to make an impact in their geographical region by sharing knowledge and helping others in their mother tongue.nne started by creating language categories on ethereum.builders. hen creating a session, simply select the language used and then your session will be displayed under the language category.nnou can find below an eample for sessions that are in nglishnnt's also easy to find and navigate through the various thereum uilders multilingual itter chatrooms. rom itter just

from fellow thereans in case you get stuck somewhere.nnet, we’ll work on making the itook also multi-lingual and polish it as it still feels kind of hacky at the moment. n this note, any help is welcome and if you would like to get involved in this pleasennget in touchnn. e could use some assistance )nns for the future, depending on how things go, in the coming weeks we’ll shift our focus to

biggest room in the world is room for improvement.” —nonymousnn hope to see many interesting projects making their appearance in the emergent thereum uilders mesh collaboration network. ven if not perfect in the current form, this is a tool that can energize the community and serve as catalyst – but again, it’s nothing without people using it.nny sharing your insights and ideas with others, besides getting eposure for your project, you’re also more likely to inspire someone to work on a project as well. nd every individual is important, as anyone could possess the right piece of the puzzle and/or insight to push everything forward.nnere are a few proposed ways to increase activity and interaction inside the thereum communitynnreate an thereum uilders session fornnelping people

meetupsnnunning a workshop or hackathonnnimply talking about things in a relaed atmospherennt's worth mentioning that even if no monetary rewards are involved in this, reputation is. e have started to keep track of the contributions and involvement in a very crude form onnnethereum.builders/co-creatorsnnnne’re all ecited about the upcoming launch, but in all this ecitement  think it is important also to keep in mind that regardless of how great the technology is, without an energized community co-creating a multi-verse of smart contracts with it, thereum's success is not guaranteed by any means.nnhat being said, the game is one of the biggest (the nternet) and this comes with deep ramifications in many areas of our civilization. he decentralized revolution ignited by the itorrent protocols is reaching well outside sharing mps. e all saw the impact itcoin had on the nternet, in just si years, as a single blockchain-based decentralized financial application.nnow here comes the questionnnow will the nternet look withnnthousandsnnof running decentralized applicationsnn’m not sure either, but making it as easy as possible for people to actually build these decentralized applications is probably a good first step towards finding out the answer.nnnd, we all know,nnthird time's a charm!nn#web here we come!
